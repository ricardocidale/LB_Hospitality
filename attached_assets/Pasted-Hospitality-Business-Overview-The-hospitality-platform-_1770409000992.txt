Hospitality Business Overview

The hospitality platform consists of two distinct but financially linked entities:

A Hospitality Management Company

A Portfolio of Properties

Each entity has its own financial statements, assumptions, funding, and lifecycle, while remaining connected through service fees.

Entity Structure
Hospitality Management Company

Operates as a standalone business with:

Income Statement

Cash Flow

Balance Sheet

Financial Analysis (including FCF-based IRR)

Provides centralized services to all properties (operations, marketing, administration, etc.)

Charges each property management/service fees, which:

Appear as revenue for the Management Company

Appear as expenses for each property

Is funded by private equity investments in tranches over time

Properties (Asset Portfolio)

Each property is modeled as:

Its own independent P&L

Its own Cash Flow

Its own Balance Sheet

Its own FCF and IRR

The system also produces:

Aggregated financials for all properties combined

Combined FCF and IRR for the full portfolio

Each property has its own set of assumptions/variables

Assumptions Framework

There are two types of assumptions:

Property-level assumptions

Revenue drivers

Operating costs

Financing structure

Acquisition date

Refinance timing

Exit cap rate

App-wide (global) assumptions

Management fee structures

Inflation/escalation rates

Shared cost growth

Tax or macro parameters

Global assumptions apply across all properties and the management company where relevant.

Capital & Lifecycle Logic
Properties

Can be acquired using:

100% equity (cash purchase), or

Debt financing + equity

Early properties may be purchased fully in cash and later refinanced after a defined period (e.g., 3 years)

Equity investors are repaid through:

Free Cash Flow distributions

Refinancing proceeds

Exit proceeds

Exits are primarily based on:

Stabilized NOI

Capitalized by a defined cap rate

Exit values are always calculated net of outstanding debt

Management Company

Receives capital from private equity in scheduled or conditional tranches

Operations depend on funding availability

Core Outputs

The system must generate:

For each individual property:

Income Statement

Cash Flow Statement

Balance Sheet

FCF-based IRR

For the Hospitality Management Company:

Same full set of financial statements and IRR

For the combined property portfolio:

Consolidated statements

Combined FCF and IRR

Dynamic Behavior

Users can:

Add or remove properties at any time

Modify any assumptions

Instantly recalculate all financial statements and returns

Mandatory Business Rules (Constraints)

Management Company Funding Gate

Operations of the Management Company cannot begin before funding is received.

If assumptions indicate operations before funding:
→ The system must block the scenario and flag it as invalid.

Property Activation Gate

A property cannot begin operating before:

The property is purchased

Funding is in place (either equity or financing)

If operating start date precedes acquisition or funding:
→ The system must block the scenario.

No Negative Cash Rule

Cash balances for:

Each property

The Management Company

The aggregated portfolio

must never be negative.

If any projected cash balance goes below zero:
→ The system must flag a funding shortfall
→ Require increased funding, earlier funding, or assumption adjustments.

Goal of the System

To simulate a scalable hospitality platform where:

Individual assets can be analyzed independently

The management company operates as a profit center

Capital flows realistically over time

Returns can be evaluated at:

asset level

company level

portfolio level

while enforcing real-world financial constraints.
