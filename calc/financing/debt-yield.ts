/**
 * calc/financing/debt-yield.ts — Debt Yield calculator and reverse loan sizing.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Computes the Debt Yield ratio and reverse-solves for the maximum loan amount
 * supportable by a minimum debt yield threshold. Debt Yield is a lender underwriting
 * metric increasingly used in commercial real estate alongside (or instead of) DSCR.
 *
 * WHAT IS DEBT YIELD?
 *   Debt Yield = Annual NOI / Loan Amount
 *
 * Unlike DSCR, debt yield is independent of interest rate, amortization period,
 * and loan term. This makes it a "structure-neutral" measure of a property's
 * ability to service debt. Lenders typically require a minimum debt yield of
 * 8–10% for stabilized hotel assets.
 *
 * REVERSE SIZING:
 *   Max Loan = NOI / min_debt_yield
 * If both a debt yield constraint and an LTV constraint are provided, the
 * binding constraint (the one producing the smaller loan) wins. This dual-
 * constraint approach mirrors real lender underwriting where the loan is sized
 * to the most restrictive of DSCR, debt yield, and LTV.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * Called from the dispatch layer as the "debt_yield" skill. The output helps
 * investors and lenders understand how much leverage a property can support
 * and which constraint is binding. The `binding_constraint` field makes it
 * easy to explain to stakeholders why a loan was sized the way it was.
