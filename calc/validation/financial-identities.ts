/**
 * calc/validation/financial-identities.ts — GAAP financial identity validator.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Validates that the three core financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement,
 * Cash Flow Statement) satisfy the fundamental accounting identities required by
 * Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Any violation indicates a bug
 * in the financial engine or a data integrity issue.
 *
 * IDENTITIES CHECKED:
 *
 * 1. BALANCE SHEET EQUATION (ASC 210):
 *    Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity
 *    This is the foundational double-entry bookkeeping identity. If it fails,
 *    every number downstream is suspect. Severity: CRITICAL.
 *
 * 2. INDIRECT METHOD OPERATING CASH FLOW (ASC 230-10-45):
 *    Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation
 *    Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces net income but does not
 *    consume cash. Adding it back converts accrual-basis net income to cash-basis
 *    operating cash flow. Severity: MATERIAL.
 *
 * 3. NET INCOME DERIVATION (ASC 220):
 *    Net Income = NOI − Interest Expense − Depreciation − Income Tax
 *    Traces the path from operating performance (NOI) to bottom-line profit.
 *    Severity: MATERIAL.
 *
 * 4. FINANCING CASH FLOW COMPOSITION (ASC 230-10-45-15):
 *    Financing Cash Flow = −Principal Payment + Refinancing Proceeds
 *    Financing activities reflect debt transactions. Interest is operating (not
 *    financing) under the indirect method. Severity: MATERIAL.
 *
 * 5. CASH RECONCILIATION (ASC 230-10-45-24):
 *    Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Change
 *    The cash flow statement must reconcile to the balance sheet's cash position.
 *    Severity: CRITICAL.
 *
 * AUDIT OPINION:
 *   - UNQUALIFIED: All identities hold within tolerance — "clean" opinion.
 *   - QUALIFIED: Minor (non-critical) variances detected — likely rounding.
 *   - ADVERSE: Critical identity failures — the statements are materially misstated.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * Called via the dispatch layer as the "financial_identities" skill. The financial
 * auditor runs this for every property in every projection period. Any ADVERSE
 * opinion triggers a red flag in the verification dashboard.
