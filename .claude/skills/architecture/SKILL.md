# Architecture & Tech Stack

## Project Summary

Hospitality Business Group is a GAAP-compliant financial simulation platform for boutique hospitality management. It models a management company alongside individual property SPVs, producing monthly and yearly financial projections with full three-statement output (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement).

The platform enforces ASC 230, ASC 360, and ASC 470 compliance, applies IRS depreciation rules (straight-line and MACRS), and includes a built-in audit and verification engine. The test suite contains 1,330+ tests covering calculation accuracy, GAAP identity checks, and golden-file reconciliation. Hosted on Replit.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **UI framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing:** Wouter
- **Data fetching:** TanStack Query
- **State management:** Zustand
- **Component library:** shadcn/ui
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **3D & animation:** Three.js (react-three/fiber, drei, postprocessing), framer-motion
- **Typography:** Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (UI and data)

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript (ESM)
- **Framework:** Express 5
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon-backed via Replit)

### Build Tooling
- **Client:** Vite
- **Server:** esbuild

## Replit Platform Services

| Service | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL via Neon — managed through Replit's built-in DB tooling |
| **Object Storage** | GCS-backed bucket for logos, property images, and exports |
| **AI Integrations** | Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic — used for market research and image generation |
| **Authentication** | Replit Auth (Login with Replit) |
| **Secrets Management** | API keys and credentials stored via Replit Secrets |
| **Deployments** | Replit Deployments for production hosting |

## Two-Entity Financial Model

### 1. Management Company
- Maintains its own Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, and FCF/IRR
- Generates revenue through management and service fees charged to properties
- Fee revenue must match property fee expenses (intercompany linkage)

### 2. Property Portfolio
- Each property is modeled as an independent SPV
- Full financial statements and returns per property
- Aggregated and consolidated portfolio views available
- Consolidation includes intercompany elimination

### Five Mandatory Business Rules
Enforced across all scenarios. See `.claude/manuals/user-manual/skills/02-business-rules.md` for details.

## User Roles

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **admin** | Full access — manage users, companies, properties, and system settings |
| **partner** | Company-level access — view and edit properties within assigned companies |
| **checker** | Read-only verification — run audits and review financial accuracy |
| **investor** | Portfolio-level read access — view dashboards and reports |
