# HBG Business Model

This skill documents the core business domain of the Hospitality Business Group (HBG) Portal — a hospitality investment simulation platform for boutique hotel assets. Every label, tooltip, and calculation in the application must use the vocabulary and structures defined here.

**Related skills:** `financial-engine` (calculation contracts), `verification-system` (audit checks), `hbg-design-philosophy` (visual identity), `integrations-infrastructure` (external services), `marcela-ai-system` (AI agent), `api-backend-contract` (server architecture), `hbg-product-vision` (product direction)

## Dual-Entity Model

HBG operates a dual-entity structure common in hospitality investment:

### Management Company (ManCo)
- The operating entity — HBG itself
- Earns fee revenue from Property SPVs (Base Fee + Incentive Fee)
- Bears corporate overhead (staffing, office, professional services, technology)
- Funded by SAFE instrument tranches during pre-profitability phase
- Does **not** own property assets directly

### Property SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles)
- Each hotel property is held in its own independent legal entity
- Isolates liability — one property's failure doesn't affect others
- Each SPV pays management fees to ManCo for operational services
- Each SPV carries its own debt, depreciation, and tax obligations
- Revenue, expenses, and cash flows are tracked independently per property

### Intercompany Elimination (ASC 810)
On consolidation, management fees paid by properties cancel against fee revenue received by ManCo. The system validates that **Fees Paid = Fees Received** within tolerance. This is required under ASC 810 (Consolidation) for accurate consolidated financial statements.

## Hospitality Revenue Streams

Revenue is modeled using industry-standard hospitality metrics:

### Room Revenue (Primary)
```
Room Revenue = Room Count × DAYS_PER_MONTH (30.5) × ADR × Occupancy
```
- **ADR** (Average Daily Rate): The average price per occupied room per night. Grows annually by `adrGrowthRate`.
- **Occupancy**: Percentage of available rooms sold. Ramps from `startOccupancy` to `maxOccupancy` via step-function growth.
- **RevPAR** (Revenue Per Available Room): `ADR × Occupancy` — the single most important performance metric in hospitality.
- **Available Room Nights**: `Room Count × 30.5 days/month`

### Ancillary Revenue Streams (as % of Room Revenue)
| Stream | Default Share | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Events & Functions | 30% | Weddings, retreats, corporate events — higher than typical hotels due to boutique wellness focus |
| Food & Beverage | 18% × (1 + Catering Boost) | Restaurant, bar, room service. Catering Boost (default 22%) adds uplift from event catering |
| Other/Ancillary | 5% | Spa, parking, gift shop, recreational activities |

### Total Revenue
```
Total Revenue = Room Revenue + Events Revenue + F&B Revenue + Other Revenue
```

## USALI Income Waterfall

The Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (USALI) defines the standard profit waterfall for hotel operations. Every line item in the portal follows this hierarchy:

```
Total Revenue
  − Departmental Expenses (Rooms, F&B, Events, Other)
  − Undistributed Operating Expenses (Admin, Marketing, Property Ops, Utilities, IT, Other)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  = GOP (Gross Operating Profit)
  − Management Fees (Base Fee + Incentive Fee)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  = AGOP (Adjusted Gross Operating Profit)
  − Property Taxes (fixed charge, escalated annually)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  = NOI (Net Operating Income)
  − FF&E Reserve
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  = ANOI (Adjusted Net Operating Income)
  − Interest Expense
  − Depreciation
  − Income Tax (with NOL carryforward at 80% cap per IRC §172)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  = Net Income
```

### Key Metrics Defined
| Metric | Definition | Significance |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **GOP** | Revenue minus all operating expenses (before management fees) | Measures property operational efficiency |
| **AGOP** | GOP minus management fees | What the property retains after paying ManCo |
| **NOI** | AGOP minus property taxes | The standard metric for property valuation (NOI / Cap Rate = Value) |
| **ANOI** | NOI minus FF&E Reserve | Cash available before debt service and taxes |
| **Net Income** | ANOI minus interest, depreciation, and income tax | Bottom-line GAAP profit |

### Expense Categories (USALI-Aligned)
| Category | Type | Default Rate | Base |
|----------|------|-------------|------|
| Rooms (Housekeeping) | Variable | 20% | Room Revenue |
| Food & Beverage | Variable | 9% | F&B Revenue |
| Events | Variable | 65% | Events Revenue |
| Other | Variable | 60% | Other Revenue |
| Admin & General | Fixed | 8% | Total Revenue (Y1 base, escalated) |
| Marketing | Variable | 1% | Total Revenue |
| Property Ops & Maintenance | Fixed | 4% | Total Revenue (Y1 base, escalated) |
| Utilities | Split | 5% | 60% variable / 40% fixed |
| IT | Fixed | 0.5% | Total Revenue (Y1 base, escalated) |
| Property Taxes | Fixed | 3% | Total Property Value / 12 (escalated) |
| FF&E Reserve | Variable | 4% | Total Revenue |
| Other Operating | Fixed | 5% | Total Revenue (Y1 base, escalated) |

**Fixed cost escalation:** Fixed expenses are anchored to Year 1 base revenue and escalated annually by the `fixedCostEscalationRate` (defaults to inflation rate). Supports annual or monthly compounding via `escalationMethod`.

## Management Fee Model

### Base Fee
- Default: **8.5% of Total Revenue**
- Compensates ManCo for day-to-day property management
- Can be replaced by granular **Service Fee Categories**

### Incentive Fee
- Default: **12% of GOP**
- Rewards ManCo when the property performs well operationally
- Only positive amounts apply: `max(0, GOP × incentiveFeeRate)`

### Service Fee Categories (Granular Breakdown)
Instead of a flat base fee, each property can break fees into specific service categories. Default categories sum to 8.5% to match the flat base rate:

| Category | Default Rate | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Marketing | 2.0% | Brand, digital campaigns, channel management |
| Technology & Reservations | 2.5% | PMS, booking engine, CRS |
| Accounting | 1.5% | Bookkeeping, reporting, audit prep |
| Revenue Management | 1.0% | Dynamic pricing, demand forecasting |
| General Management | 1.5% | Executive oversight, HR |

Each category supports **Direct vs Centralized/Pass-Through** delivery models with a markup waterfall for cost-of-services analysis.

## Management Company Overhead

### Fixed Costs (escalated by inflation annually)
| Item | Default Annual | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Office Lease | $36,000 | Physical office space |
| Professional Services | $24,000 | Legal, accounting, audit |
| Technology Infrastructure | $18,000 | Cloud hosting, SaaS tools |

### Variable Costs
| Item | Default | Basis |
|------|---------|-------|
| Travel | $12,000/property/year | Per active property |
| IT Licensing | $3,000/property/year | Per active property |
| Marketing | 5% | Of total fee revenue |
| Miscellaneous Ops | 3% | Of total fee revenue |

### Staffing Tiers
Headcount scales with portfolio size:

| Tier | Max Properties | FTE | Default Salary |
|------|---------------|-----|---------------|
| Tier 1 | ≤ 3 | 2.5 | $75,000/year |
| Tier 2 | ≤ 6 | 4.5 | $75,000/year |
| Tier 3 | 7+ | 7.0 | $75,000/year |

### Partner Compensation (10-Year Fixed Schedule)
| Years | Annual Compensation (Total) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Y1–Y3 | $540,000 |
| Y4–Y5 | $600,000 |
| Y6–Y7 | $700,000 |
| Y8–Y9 | $800,000 |
| Y10 | $900,000 |

## SAFE Funding Vehicle

The management company is funded during its pre-profitability phase through a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) instrument:

- **Two tranches** with configurable dates, amounts, valuation cap, and discount rate
- Default tranche amount: $800,000 each
- Optional interest rate with configurable payment frequency (accrues only, quarterly, or annually)
- **Operational gate rule:** No ManCo revenue or expenses accrue until BOTH `companyOpsStartDate` AND `safeTranche1Date` are reached. This is a strict gate — even one day early returns zero.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) System

The ICP defines what properties HBG targets for acquisition:

### Physical Parameters
- Room count range, land area, total square footage
- Property type preferences (boutique hotel, resort, bed & breakfast)

### Amenity Priorities
- **Must Have** — non-negotiable (e.g., wellness spa, event space)
- **Major Plus** — strongly preferred
- **Nice to Have** — desirable but not required
- **Exclude** — deal-breakers

### Financial Targets
- ADR range, Occupancy range, RevPAR range
- Target IRR, equity multiple
- Purchase price range

### Location Definitions
- Geographic markets with radius search
- Proximity requirements (airports, comparable hotels, amenities)

The ICP drives AI-powered company research prompts — physical parameters, amenity priorities, and financial targets are formatted into system prompts that guide LLM property research.

## Make-vs-Buy Analysis

For each service fee category, the system computes:
```
Total In-House Cost = Internal FTE × Salary + Overhead
Total Vendor Cost = External service provider quote + Management overhead
Savings = Total In-House Cost − Total Vendor Cost
```
A savings threshold recommendation helps ManCo decide whether to deliver services in-house or outsource to specialized vendors.

## Property Lifecycle

Every property moves through a defined investment lifecycle:

```
Acquisition → Pre-Opening → Operations → Hold Period → Refinance (optional) → Exit/Disposition
```

| Stage | Description | Financial Impact |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Acquisition** | Property purchased, debt begins | `acquisitionDate` starts debt service and depreciation |
| **Pre-Opening** | Renovation/construction before hotel opens | Debt service accrues with no revenue (cash burn) |
| **Operations** | Hotel is open for guests | Revenue begins at `operationsStartDate`; occupancy ramps |
| **Hold Period** | Active operations during investment horizon | Default 10-year projection (120 months) |
| **Refinance** | Optional new loan replaces acquisition debt | Based on stabilized NOI / cap rate × refi LTV |
| **Exit/Disposition** | Property sold at end of hold period | Exit Value = (Terminal NOI / Cap Rate) − Commission − Outstanding Debt |

### Key Dates
- **`acquisitionDate`**: When the property is purchased. Debt and depreciation begin. Defaults to `operationsStartDate` if omitted.
- **`operationsStartDate`**: When the hotel opens for business. Revenue and variable expenses start. May be later than `acquisitionDate`.
