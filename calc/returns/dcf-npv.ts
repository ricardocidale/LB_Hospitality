/**
 * calc/returns/dcf-npv.ts — Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV) calculator.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Computes the Net Present Value of a series of cash flows discounted at a given rate.
 * DCF analysis is the cornerstone of investment valuation — it answers the question:
 * "What is a stream of future cash flows worth in today's dollars?"
 *
 * THE DCF FORMULA:
 *   NPV = Σ [CF_t / (1 + r)^t]  for t = 0, 1, 2, ..., n
 *
 * Where:
 *   CF_t = cash flow in period t
 *   r    = discount rate (required rate of return / cost of capital)
 *   t    = period index (0-based; period 0 is "today", not discounted)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The cash_flows array uses t=0 as the first element. Period 0 is NOT
 * discounted (divisor = (1+r)^0 = 1). This convention means the initial investment
 * (negative cash flow) at t=0 is at face value, and future returns are discounted.
 *
 * IRR CROSS-CHECK:
 * If an IRR value is provided, the function verifies that NPV ≈ 0 when the cash
 * flows are discounted at the IRR. This catches IRR calculation errors in the
 * upstream `irr-vector` module. By definition, IRR is the rate r where NPV = 0.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * Called via the dispatch layer as the "dcf" skill. Used by the financial engine
 * to value properties, compute the NPV of hold-vs-sell scenarios, and validate
 * IRR results. The `pv_timeline` output lets the UI show period-by-period
 * present value waterfall charts.
