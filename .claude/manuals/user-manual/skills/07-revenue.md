# Chapter 7: Revenue Calculations

All revenue in the model flows from a single foundation: room revenue. The three ancillary revenue streams — events, food and beverage, and other income — are each calculated as a percentage of room revenue, creating a simple and transparent revenue structure that scales naturally with the property's core business.

## Room Revenue

Room revenue is the primary revenue driver for every property. It is calculated monthly using the following formula:

**Room Revenue = Room Count × Average Daily Rate × Occupancy Rate × 30.5 days**

The 30.5-day month (365 days divided by 12, rounded) is the standard convention used throughout the hospitality industry for monthly revenue calculations. The average daily rate grows at 3% per year, compounding annually, reflecting typical rate inflation for well-positioned boutique properties.

No revenue is generated before the property's operations start date. This ensures that the model accurately reflects the timeline from acquisition through the beginning of guest operations.

## Ancillary Revenue Streams

Three additional revenue streams supplement room revenue, each expressed as a share of the base room revenue figure:

| Revenue Stream | Default Share of Room Revenue |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Events | 43% |
| Food & Beverage | 22%, with a 30% catering boost |
| Other Income | 7% |

**Events revenue** captures income from weddings, corporate retreats, private dining, and other hosted events. At 43% of room revenue, this reflects the significant events capacity typical of boutique hospitality properties.

**Food and beverage revenue** starts at 22% of room revenue and then receives an additional 30% catering boost, reflecting the uplift from event-related catering services. The effective F&B share is therefore approximately 28.6% of room revenue.

**Other income** at 7% of room revenue covers ancillary sources such as spa services, parking, resort fees, and retail operations.

All revenue shares are configurable at the property level, allowing you to tailor the revenue mix to each property's unique characteristics and market positioning.
