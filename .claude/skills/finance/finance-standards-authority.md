# Finance Standards Authority

When working on finance, statements, consolidation, refinancing, or returns, use the tool `get_financial_standards_authority` to retrieve the authoritative ruleset and links. Treat the tool output as the single source of truth for classification, statement structure, eliminations, and ambiguity handling. If a rule is unclear, follow the ambiguity protocol from the tool output and cite the relevant authoritative link.
