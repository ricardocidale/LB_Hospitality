# Chapter 9: Gross Operating Profit and Net Operating Income

Two profitability metrics sit at the heart of hotel financial analysis: Gross Operating Profit (GOP) and Net Operating Income (NOI). Together, they tell you how efficiently a property converts revenue into profit at two different levels of the income statement.

## Gross Operating Profit (GOP)

Gross Operating Profit measures a property's efficiency at the departmental level. It is calculated as:

**GOP = Total Revenue − Departmental Expenses (Rooms + Food & Beverage + Events + Other)**

GOP captures the profit generated by the property's revenue-producing departments before accounting for overhead costs, management fees, or capital reserves. It answers the question: "How much profit do the operating departments generate on their own?"

A stabilized boutique hotel typically achieves a GOP margin in the range of 40% to 60% of total revenue. Properties with strong events programs and high occupancy tend toward the upper end of this range.

## Net Operating Income (NOI)

Net Operating Income takes the analysis a step further by deducting the property's undistributed expenses, management fees, and FF&E reserve from GOP:

**NOI = GOP − Undistributed Expenses − Management Fees − FF&E Reserve**

NOI is the single most important metric for property valuation because it represents the income available to service debt and provide returns to investors — before interest, depreciation, and income tax. When a property's value is estimated using a capitalization rate (as it is at exit), NOI is the numerator in that calculation.

A stabilized boutique hotel typically achieves an NOI margin between 15% and 45% of total revenue, depending on cost structure, market conditions, and management efficiency.

## Management Fees

Management fees are a key deduction between GOP and NOI. They represent the cost of professional hotel management and flow as revenue to the management company (Hospitality Business Co.):

- **Base management fee**: 5% of the property's total revenue
- **Incentive management fee**: 15% of GOP above a defined threshold

The incentive fee structure aligns the management company's interests with property performance — the better the property operates, the more the management company earns.
