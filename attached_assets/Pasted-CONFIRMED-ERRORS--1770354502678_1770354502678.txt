CONFIRMED ERRORS                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  HIGH SEVERITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

  1. FFE Expense Double-Counted
  financialEngine.ts:350,354
  - Line 350: totalOperatingExpenses includes expenseFFE
  - Line 354: noi = gop - feeBase - feeIncentive - expenseFFE subtracts it again
  - Impact: NOI is understated by 1x the FF&E expense every month (typically 4% of revenue)

  2. Zero-Interest Loans Skip All Debt Calculations
  financialEngine.ts:365-387
  - Condition: if (loanAmount > 0 && r > 0) — when interest rate is 0%, the entire block is skipped
  - debtPayment, interestExpense, principalPayment all stay at 0
  - Impact: 0% interest loans never pay down principal, debt never reduces on the balance sheet

  3. Refinance Outstanding Balance Off-by-One
  loanCalculations.ts:260
  - Code: const yearsFromRefi = yearEnd - refi.refiYear + 1
  - The + 1 means in the refinance year itself, it calculates as if 1 full year of payments already passed
  - Impact: Debt outstanding is understated in the refinance year

  4. Refinance Proceeds Use Prior Year's Debt Balance
  loanCalculations.ts:240
  - Code: const existingDebt = getAcquisitionOutstandingBalance(loan, refiYear - 1)
  - Uses refiYear - 1 (debt at end of previous year) instead of refiYear (debt at time of refinancing)
  - Impact: Refinance proceeds are overstated (less debt subtracted than actually owed)

  5. Balance Sheet Debt Outstanding Off by One Year
  ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:105
  - Code: const debtOutstanding = getOutstandingDebtAtYear(loan, refi, year - 1)
  - Reports debt as of the prior year, not the current year
  - Impact: Liabilities are understated, balance sheet doesn't balance correctly

  6. Missing techInfrastructure in Company Cash Flow Fixed Overhead
  Company.tsx:345
  - Aggregates officeLease + professionalServices + businessInsurance but omits techInfrastructure
  - The Income Statement at line 961 and Cash Flow Table at line 1298 correctly include all four
  - Impact: Fixed Overhead understated by ~$18,000/year in the cash flow data export

  MEDIUM SEVERITY

  7. Simple Average ADR Instead of Weighted Average
  Dashboard.tsx:235
  - Code: const avgADR = properties.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.startAdr, 0) / totalProperties
  - Uses simple average when a proper weighted function getWeightedMetrics() already exists at line 184
  - Impact: Portfolio ADR metric ignores property size differences (a 50-room hotel weighted same as 200-room)

  8. Cash-on-Cash Subtracts Exit Value That Was Already Added
  Dashboard.tsx:452-458
  - consolidatedFlows already includes exit value at year 10 (line 436)
  - Then operatingCashFlows map subtracts exit value again at idx === 9
  - Impact: Year 10 operating cash flow is correct (exit removed), but only if the intent is pure operating CF. The metric definition may be misleading.

  9. Auditor Incentive Fee Formula is Circular
  financialAuditor.ts:691
  - Code: const expectedIncentiveFee = m.noi > 0 ? (m.noi + m.feeIncentive) * global.incentiveManagementFee : 0
  - Uses m.feeIncentive (the value being verified) in the "expected" calculation
  - Engine actually calculates: feeIncentive = Math.max(0, gop * global.incentiveManagementFee)
  - Impact: Auditor never actually validates incentive fees — it just confirms the data against itself

  10. Accumulated Depreciation Off-by-One
  financialEngine.ts:394
  - Code: monthlyDepreciation * (monthsSinceAcquisition + 1)
  - At acquisition month (month 0), accumulated depreciation = 1 month's worth
  - Impact: Accumulated depreciation is overstated by 1 month throughout the projection

  LOW SEVERITY

  11. Loan Balance Can Go Negative at End of Term
  loanCalculations.ts:327,313
  - remainingBalance -= principalPayment with no Math.max(0, ...) guard
  - Near end of loan when balance is tiny, full payment overshoots
  - Impact: Small negative balance values could propagate into debt calculations

  12. Division by Zero Risk on Exit Cap Rate
  loanCalculations.ts:224,356
  - propertyValue = stabilizedNOI / exitCapRate — no guard against exitCapRate === 0
  - Impact: Would produce Infinity if user sets cap rate to 0%

  13. Date Math Inconsistency in Auditor
  financialAuditor.ts:743-744 vs elsewhere
  - Manual date math (year * 12 + month) used instead of differenceInMonths() used elsewhere
  - Impact: Potential edge case bugs at month boundaries
