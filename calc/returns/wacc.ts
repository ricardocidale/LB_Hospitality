/**
 * calc/returns/wacc.ts — Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) calculator.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Computes the blended cost of capital for a property or portfolio, weighting
 * the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt by their respective shares
 * of the capital structure. WACC is the appropriate discount rate for DCF
 * valuation of levered real estate investments.
 *
 * THE WACC FORMULA:
 *   WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 − T))
 *
 * Where:
 *   E   = market value of equity
 *   D   = market value of debt
 *   V   = E + D (total capital)
 *   Re  = cost of equity (user-provided; typically 15–25% for private hospitality)
 *   Rd  = cost of debt (interest rate on borrowings)
 *   T   = corporate tax rate (tax shield on interest)
 *
 * INTERMEDIATE APPROACH (no CAPM):
 * For private hospitality companies, beta is unreliable. Users input Re directly
 * based on their required equity return, rather than deriving it via CAPM
 * (Rf + β × ERP). This is standard practice for private real estate.
 *
 * PORTFOLIO WACC:
 * For multi-property portfolios, WACC is computed as the capital-weighted
 * average across all properties. Each property contributes its equity and
 * debt to the portfolio totals, with its own cost of debt.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * Registered in calc/dispatch.ts as "compute_wacc". Output feeds into
 * calculate_dcf_npv as the discount_rate parameter for property and
 * portfolio valuation.
