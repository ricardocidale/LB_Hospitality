/**
 * refinance-calculator.ts — Hotel Property Refinance Engine
 *
 * When a hotel property's value increases (through higher NOI or market appreciation),
 * the owner can refinance — take out a new, larger loan to pay off the old one and
 * pocket the difference as tax-free cash (called "cash-out refinance").
 *
 * This is one of the most important wealth-building strategies in real estate:
 * you get cash without selling the property, and the cash isn't taxed because
 * it's borrowed money (a liability), not income.
 *
 * The refinance calculation pipeline has 8 steps:
 *   1. Validate inputs (no negative values, rates within bounds, etc.)
 *   2. Compute payoff — how much is needed to retire the old loan
 *      (remaining balance + prepayment penalty + accrued interest)
 *   3. Size the new loan — the lesser of LTV max and DSCR constraint
 *      LTV (Loan-to-Value): New loan ≤ X% of property value (e.g., 75%)
 *      DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio): Annual NOI ÷ annual debt service ≥ Y (e.g., 1.25×)
 *      The binding constraint (whichever produces the smaller loan) wins.
 *   4. Compute cash-out = New loan net proceeds - Payoff amount
 *      If negative (new loan doesn't cover old debt), cash-out is zero.
 *   5. Build a proceeds breakdown (like a settlement statement at closing)
 *   6. Generate the new loan's amortization schedule (monthly payments)
 *   7. Build journal hooks — pre-formatted accounting entries for GAAP journals
 *   8. Assemble flags (which constraint bound, whether cash-out was negative)
 *
 * GAAP treatment:
 *   - Old debt removal and new debt recording are separate journal entries
 *   - Prepayment penalties and closing costs are expensed in the period incurred
 *   - Cash-out is classified as financing cash flow (ASC 230), never as income
 *   - Only interest from the new loan flows through the income statement

 * Main entry point for the Refinance Calculator.

 * Computes refinance proceeds, payoff amounts, penalties, new debt schedule,
 * and equity cash-out. Returns structured flags and journal hooks.
 *
 * GAAP invariants enforced:
 * - Payoff reduces old debt; new debt recorded separately
 * - Penalties/fees recognized in period incurred (default policy)
 * - Cash-out is financing cash flow, not income
 * - Only interest hits IS; principal reduces BS/CF
