/**
 * schedule.ts — Debt Service Schedule Builder
 *
 * Produces a month-by-month loan amortization schedule, which is central to
 * the pro forma model. The schedule shows, for each month of the loan:
 *   - Beginning balance (what you owe at the start of the month)
 *   - Interest payment (balance × monthly rate — this is an income statement expense)
 *   - Principal payment (reduces the loan balance — this is balance sheet only)
 *   - Total payment (interest + principal — this is the actual cash leaving)
 *   - Ending balance (beginning balance - principal)
 *
 * Two-phase structure:
 *   Phase 1 — Interest-Only (IO): During the IO period, you only pay interest.
 *     The loan balance doesn't decrease. Hotels often have IO periods because
 *     they need time to ramp up occupancy before generating enough cash for
 *     full amortizing payments.
 *
 *   Phase 2 — Amortizing: After IO ends, the PMT formula kicks in. The payment
 *     amount stays constant, but each month more goes to principal and less to
 *     interest (because the balance is shrinking, so interest shrinks too).
 *
 * Balloon payment: If amortization_months > term_months (e.g., 30-year amortization
 * on a 10-year term), the loan won't be fully paid off by maturity. The remaining
 * balance is due as a "balloon" payment in the final month. The final month logic
 * handles this by setting principal = remaining balance, which may be a large amount.
 *
 * The rounding policy ensures consistent decimal treatment. The final-month cleanup
 * prevents "rounding dust" — tiny leftover balances like $0.003 that would otherwise
 * appear on financial statements.

 *
 * After IO period (month io_months to term_months-1):
 *   PMT computed on full loan amount over amortization_months.
 *   If amortization_months > remaining term, a balloon exists at maturity.
 *   Final month: principal = remaining balance (prevents rounding dust).
