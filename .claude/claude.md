## User Preferences

- Simple, everyday language. Ask clarifying questions before implementing — do not assume.
- **TOP PRIORITY: Financial accuracy always beats UI enhancements.** The proof system must always pass.
- Always format money as currency (commas, appropriate precision).
- All skills live in `.claude/skills/`; `.agents/skills/` contains slim pointers for Replit task agent compatibility.
- Company name is "Hospitality Business Group" (or "Hospitality Business" for short).
- Update skills and manuals after every feature change.
- **Doc Harmony Rule:** `replit.md` and `.claude/claude.md` must stay in sync. Both are standalone, comprehensive project docs — neither is a "pointer" to the other. When updating one, update the other. The health check enforces matching test counts and stats across both files.
- All UI components must reference a theme via the theme engine.
- New UI features get their own skill file in `.claude/skills/ui/`.
- **Button Label Consistency:** Always "Save" — never "Update". See `rules/ui-patterns.md`.
- **100% Session Memory:** Save decisions to `.claude/session-memory.md` at session end.
- **Every financial line item** should have a ? tooltip (HelpTooltip or InfoTooltip).
- **Every page must be graphics-rich** — charts, animations, visual elements required.
- **Context reduction is mandatory.** Every refactor must produce skills, helpers, scripts. See `skills/coding-conventions/context-reduction.md`.
- **Premium design, always.** $50K+ bespoke financial platform feel. See `rules/design-standards.md`.
- **Always update claude.md after every task.** Mandatory — no exceptions.

## Current Theme

**Tuscan Olive Grove** (olive-sage) is default. 5 presets available. See `.claude/skills/ui/theme-engine.md`.

---

## Context Loading Protocol

With 191 skill files, **never load all skills at once**. Use `.claude/skills/context-loading/SKILL.md` to find the minimum required set. Quick rules:
- **Financial calc** → specific finance skill + `rules/audit-persona.md` + `proof-system/SKILL.md`
- **UI/visual** → `component-library/SKILL.md` + `ui/theme-engine.md` + specific UI skill
- **Testing** → `testing/SKILL.md` + relevant sub-skill only
- **Cross-domain** → 2–4 skills max per domain

## Recent Changes (April 4, 2026)

- **Input Validation Hardening (Phase 11)** (Task #277) — Comprehensive audit of all POST/PUT/PATCH handlers confirmed 100% Zod coverage. Fixed remaining gaps: added `prospectiveNotesSchema` for `PATCH /api/property-finder/prospective/:id/notes` (was reading `req.body.notes` without validation), added `adminLoginSchema` for `POST /api/auth/admin-login` (was manually destructuring password). Research fallback: when AI returns unparseable JSON (`rawResponse === true`) for property research, market_research storage is now skipped with a warning log (property value application was already guarded). Schemas added to `server/routes/helpers.ts`.
- **Observability & Error Handling (Phase 10)** (Task #276) — Verified zero unstructured `console.error/warn/log` in server code (only `server/logger.ts` uses `console.log` as the structured output). Upgraded `Sentry.ErrorBoundary` fallback in `App.tsx` from empty div to styled card with icon, message, and reload button. Added `logActivity("apply-research-values")` in `server/routes/research.ts` for AI research value application to properties (fields applied count, warning/failure metadata). All financial mutations now covered by activity logging.
- **JSONB Type Safety (Phase 8)** (Task #275) — All JSONB columns now carry `.$type<>()` annotations: `standardAcqPackage` → `StandardAcqPackage`, `debtAssumptions` → `DebtAssumptions`, `assetDefinition` → `AssetDefinition` in `config.ts`; `consolidatedYearlyJson` → `ConsolidatedYearlyJson` in `scenario-results.ts`; `metadata` → `NotificationLogMetadata`, `rawExtractionData` → `RawExtractionData` in `notifications.ts`; `seedValue` → `unknown` in `seedDefaults`. Eliminated all `z.any()` from Zod insert schemas (replaced with `z.unknown()` or `z.record(z.unknown())`). Removed unsafe `as Record<string, unknown>` cast in chat routes (now uses typed `AssetDefinition` directly). Six new shape interfaces added to `jsonb-shapes.ts`.
- **Deep Re-Audit (Phase 7)** (Task #274) — 7 audit files in `tests/audit/` (added `checker-architecture.test.ts` covering calculation checker boundary enforcement, adapter wiring verification, verification endpoint access policy, calc/validation module independence). All 123 audit assertions passing. Full architecture documentation updated.
- **Calculation Checker Consolidation (Phase 6)** (Task #273) — Added `reconcileSchedule` adapter to `server/calculation-checker/adapters.ts`. All 3 `calc/validation` modules now wired: `validateFinancialIdentities`, `checkFundingGates`, `reconcileSchedule`. Independent amortization schedule computation via `calc/shared/pmt.ts`. Boundary enforcement test prevents `@engine/` imports in checker code.
- **Deep Re-Audit & Final Quality Gate** (Task #268) — 6 audit test files in `tests/audit/` covering: data-flow integrity (engine pipeline trace, chain identity, precision, determinism), cache invalidation (hit/miss/clear, mutation path coverage, consistency under repeated access), scenario save/load (roundtrip hash, consolidation, persistence infra), endpoint security (auth, rate limiting, Zod validation, no hardcoded secrets), export parity (verifyExport checks, pipeline structure, hash stability), integration pipeline (engine→service→export contract verification, portfolio consolidation parity, scenario persistence roundtrip simulation, export data shape contracts, file-based server structure verification).
- **Zod Validation + Rate Limiting** (Task #266) — All unprotected POST/PUT/PATCH handlers now use Zod schema validation. `marketRatePatchSchema` uses `z.coerce.number` for backward compat. Rate limiting on compute-heavy endpoints.
- **ESLint CI + Pre-Commit Hooks** (Task #267) — ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) scoped to `calc/` and `engine/` bans `Math.pow`, `|| 0`, `as any`, bare `any`, `safeNum`. Husky pre-commit hooks + lint-staged. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for PR enforcement.

## Recent Changes (April 3, 2026)

- **Scenario Computed Snapshot Persistence** (Task C) — `scenario_results` table stores immutable computed artifacts (consolidated yearly JSON, output hash, inputs hash, audit opinion, engine version). Three endpoints: `POST /api/scenarios/:id/recompute` (full pipeline + persist + drift detection), `GET /api/scenarios/:id/results/latest`, `POST /api/scenarios/:id/drift-check` (engine-version-aware: `match` / `input_changed` / `engine_changed`). Scenarios table has denormalized `lastOutputHash`, `lastComputedAt`, `lastEngineVersion` pointers.
- **Export Reproducibility Lock** (Task B) — `server/report/server-export-data.ts` builds IS/CF statements from server-recomputed data. `computeRef` in export requests triggers server-authoritative pipeline, ignoring client payload. `X-Finance-Output-Hash` + `X-Finance-Engine-Version` response headers. Legacy path unchanged.
- **Server-Side Export Generation** (Phase 4) — `POST /api/exports/generate` endpoint generates PDF/Excel/PPTX/DOCX/CSV exports server-side. Accepts `{ entityType, entityId?, format, orientation, version, projectionYears, reportScope }`. `version` controls row detail (`short` = summary, `extended` = full). `reportScope` filters statements (`all | income | cashflow | balance | overview | investment`). Builders: `buildExportData` (portfolio), `buildPropertyExportData`, `buildCompanyExportData`. CSV generator: `server/exports/csv-generator.ts`. `USE_SERVER_EXPORTS=true` feature flag. Client `ExportDialog` passes `ServerExportConfig` with `reportScope` from active tab. Client fallback preserved.

## Recent Changes (March 23, 2026)

- **Admin Scenario Governance** (Task #235) — Admin scenario governance and assignment management.
- **KPI Cover Pages Permanently Removed** — Removed both KPI generation paths from report compiler (`compileReport`). No KPI sections or cover pages in ANY PDF export, ever.
- **Chart Screenshots in Premium PDF** — Client captures Overview charts via `dom-to-image-more` → base64 PNG in payload `chartScreenshots[]` → server embeds via `@react-pdf/renderer` `Image` component. CSS cleanup sheet injected during capture (transparent borders, no shadows).
- **Admin LLM Recommendations** — Per-domain differentiated LLM recommendations: Gemini 2.5 Pro (company/property research), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (market/chatbot), GPT-4.1 Mini (utilities), Claude Sonnet 4 (graphics). Star icon hints below card titles.
- **Premium Overview PDF Polish** (Task #230) — Removed header accent bar, increased font sizes, denser pagination for Overview PDF exports.
- **Line-Item Detail Toggle Removal** (Task #228) — Removed conflicting line-item detail toggle from export UI.
- **Premium PDF Theme Compliance** (Task #227) — Removed out-of-theme colors from premium PDF, added LLM design pass for layout hints, dropped Puppeteer dependency for PDF (retained for PNG only).
- **Hardcoded Green → Theme Tokens** (Task #226) — Replaced all hardcoded green color values with theme CSS variable tokens.
- **Overview PDF Export & Cover Page Removal** (Task #225) — Fixed Overview tab premium PDF export. Cover pages permanently removed from all export formats.
- **Unified Report Compiler** (Task #224) — Built `server/report/compiler.ts` with single `compileReport()` → `ReportDefinition` IR consumed by all 5 format renderers. No AI calls in any renderer.
- **Premium PDF Engine Replacement** (Task #223) — Replaced puppeteer-core + AI HTML pipeline with @react-pdf/renderer for premium PDF exports.

## Changes (March 16, 2026)

- **Premium PDF Export Redesign** — Switched premium export AI backend from Anthropic to Gemini 2.5 Flash. Enterprise-quality PDF design with branded headers, KPI cards, callout blocks.
- **Model Defaults Admin Section** — New "Model Defaults" tab in Admin > Business group with Market & Macro and Property Underwriting sub-tabs.
- **Verification Bug Fixes** — Fixed DSCR check for pre-operational Year 1 properties, Net Income/Cash Flow identity checks for NOL carryforward.
- **Multi-Vendor Research LLMs** — Vendor-agnostic `ResearchClient` with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini adapters.
- **Settings Elimination & Access Control** (Task #168) — Eliminated General Settings page. Two-surface model: Company Assumptions + Admin.
- **Governance Harmonization** (Task #153) — 7 new skills, 13 slim pointers.
- **Configuration Terminology Refresh** (Tasks #180–182) — Standardized "seed defaults", "live assumptions", "config switches" vocabulary.
- **USALI Restructure** — All property-level IS and CF statements follow USALI 12th Edition order.
- **Insurance Removal** — Removed insurance expense from entire codebase. NOI = IBFC − Property Taxes.
- **Fee Category Restructure** (Tasks #108–#109), **Funding Interest** (Task #116), **Login Redesign** (Tasks #63, #131), **ICP Split** (Task #71), **LLM Dual-Model** (Task #101), **DocuSign/Slack Removal** (Tasks #133–134), **Resend Email** (Task #68), **Excel Standardization** (Task #112), **Admin Hardening** (March 13), **Norfolk AI Theme** (Task #84), **DB Integrity** (Task #80), **Deterministic Calcs** (Task #64).

## Export System

Full reference: `.claude/skills/exports/SKILL.md`. SDD: `.claude/skills/exports/premium-export-spec.md`.
- **Unified Report Compiler**: `server/report/compiler.ts` — single `compileReport()` produces a `ReportDefinition` IR (types in `server/report/types.ts`) consumed by all 5 format renderers. Consolidates section selection, value formatting, formula-row filtering, chart series extraction, investment section splitting, and theme resolution. KPI sections are never generated.
- **Premium Export**: `POST /api/exports/premium` — All 5 formats (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, XLSX, PNG) compile once via `compileReport()` then dispatch to format-specific renderers. No LLM calls for any format.
- **Export Reproducibility Lock**: When `computeRef` is present in export requests, `server/report/server-export-data.ts` fetches properties + global assumptions from DB, runs `computePortfolioProjection` server-side, and produces deterministic IS/CF statements, rows, and metrics — ignoring client payload entirely. Response headers `X-Finance-Output-Hash` (SHA-256) and `X-Finance-Engine-Version` accompany each server-recomputed export. Legacy path unchanged when `computeRef` absent.
- **Scenario Computed Snapshot Persistence**: `scenario_results` table stores immutable computed artifacts (consolidated yearly JSON, output hash, inputs hash, audit opinion, engine version) per scenario. `POST /api/scenarios/:id/recompute` runs full pipeline + persists + drift detection. `GET /api/scenarios/:id/results/latest` returns most recent. `POST /api/scenarios/:id/drift-check` engine-version-aware (`match` / `input_changed` / `engine_changed`). Scenarios table carries denormalized `lastOutputHash`, `lastComputedAt`, `lastEngineVersion` pointers.
- **Format renderers**: PDF (`server/pdf/render.tsx` via @react-pdf/renderer), PPTX (`generatePptxFromReport`), XLSX (`generateExcelFromReport`), DOCX (`generateDocxFromReport`), PNG (`generatePngFromReport` via browser screenshots). Each accepts a `ReportDefinition` with pre-formatted values and design tokens. Supports `ImageSection` for embedded chart screenshots.
- **Chart screenshots**: Client captures Overview charts via `dom-to-image-more` (3 targets: `data-export-section="investment-chart"`, `"revenue-chart"`, `"distribution-chart"`), sends as base64 PNG array in `chartScreenshots[]`. Server embeds via `@react-pdf/renderer` `Image` component. `captureOverviewCharts.ts` injects CSS cleanup sheet during capture (transparent borders, no shadows).
- **Client-side fallback** (when premium toggle off): jsPDF, pptxgenjs, SheetJS, CSV, dom-to-image-more.
- **Page dimensions**: Landscape = 16:9 (406.4mm × 228.6mm), Portrait = US Letter (215.9mm × 279.4mm).
- **Browser rendering**: `server/browser-renderer.ts` — Puppeteer with system Chromium. Used for PNG rendering only.
- **Report structure**: Statement→Chart interleaving. Each statement table is followed by a chart page. Overview tab produces multi-page reports with chart screenshots, projection tables, portfolio composition, property insights, distribution tables, and USALI waterfall. No cover pages, no KPI sections — ever.
- **Export Rules** (see `.claude/rules/exports.md`):
  1. **Full-scope**: Export from ANY tab exports ALL statements — never just the active tab.
  2. **Formula filtering**: Rows with `isItalic=true` never exported.
  3. **Short/Extended**: Short = header/total rows; Extended = all line items. Controlled via `summaryOnly` parameter.
  4. **Theme colors**: Client sends `themeColors` array; server resolves via `resolveThemeColors()`.
  5. **File save**: `saveFile()` tries native `showSaveFilePicker` (Chrome/Comet), falls back to download.
  6. **Single button**: One `ExportMenu` per page in tab bar — no per-tab export buttons.
  7. **Tables never split**: `wrap={false}` on all section Views. Tables move to next page intact unless larger than a page.
  8. **Thin hairlines**: Table borders use hairline widths (0.25–0.75pt) with `theme.foreground` color for strong contrast against white.
  9. **Chart series keywords**: Must match actual row labels (e.g., "cash flow from operations" not "free cash flow").

---

## Key Rules

- **Calculations always highest priority** — never compromise financial accuracy for visuals
- **No raw hex in components** — use CSS variable tokens
- **All buttons GlassButton**, all pages PageHeader, all exports ExportMenu
- **No mock data** in production paths
- **Finance changes must state Active Skill** and pass verification (UNQUALIFIED)
- **ANOI terminology**: After-fee NOI = "Adjusted NOI (ANOI)". Internal field stays `noi`.
- **Marcela must NEVER compute financial values** — all data from the calculation engine
- **Engine chain**: `gop = revenue − opex`, `agop = gop − feeBase − feeIncentive`, `noi = agop − expenseTaxes`, `anoi = noi − expenseFFE`
- **Balance Sheet Identity**: A = L + E must hold within $1. Cash derivation uses `m.anoi` (never `m.noi`). See `rules/balance-sheet-identity.md`.
- **Brand colors**: SAGE=#9FBCA4, DARK_GREEN=#257D41, NAVY=#1A2332, SECTION_BG=#EFF5F0, ALT_ROW=#F8FAF9
- **normalizeCaps() abbreviations**: GOP, NOI, AGOP, ANOI, GAAP, FFE, FF&E, DSCR, IRR, CFO, ADR, REVPAR, LTV, EBITDA, WACC
- **Icon standard**: `IconPlay` for "Run Research", `IconEye` for "Criteria", `IconBanknote` for Reconciliation
- **Resend replaces SendGrid** for all transactional email — `server/services/resend.ts`
- **ICP = Profile + Research Center** — two separate pages, not one monolithic ICP page
- **LLM dual-model config** — primary + fallback model with vendor selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) in Admin LLM tab. 7 domains: Company Research, Property Research, Market Research, Report Generation, Chatbot (Rebecca), Premium Exports, AI Utilities. All AI model selections defined in admin LLMs page only — no hardcoded models anywhere.
- **Norfolk AI theme** — additional theme preset alongside Tuscan Olive Grove
- **Settings placement** — General Settings page eliminated (Task #168). Two surfaces: Company Assumptions (admin-only, entity config), Admin panel (system config). Calc transparency + tour toggles moved to Admin Navigation tab. Auto-research toggle moved to Admin Research Center tab. Non-admins see read-only Model Inputs panel on Company page.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `admin` | Full — all pages + Admin Settings |
| `user` | Management-level — no Admin panel |
| `checker` | User + verification tools |
| `investor` | Limited — Dashboard, Properties, Profile, Help |

---

## Database Migration Pattern

Consolidated Drizzle-managed SQL migrations in `migrations/`. 7 migration files:
- `0000_brainy_mother_askani.sql` — initial schema
- `0001_optional_password_hash.sql` — optional password hash
- `0002_db_integrity_hardening.sql` — FK indexes, composite indexes, constraints
- `0003_add_business_insurance.sql` — business insurance fields
- `0004_consolidated_schema.sql` — consolidated schema (all tables)
- `0005_google_drive_tokens.sql` — Google Drive token storage
- `0006_add_missing_indexes.sql` — additional performance indexes

Old individual `server/migrations/*.ts` files have been superseded by this consolidated Drizzle migration structure.

---

## Governed Model Constants (DB-Backed)

`DEPRECIATION_YEARS` (27.5) and `DAYS_PER_MONTH` (30.5) are now DB-backed with constant fallbacks. Cascade: `property.depreciationYears → global.depreciationYears → DEPRECIATION_YEARS constant (27.5)`. `daysPerMonth` is global-only: `global.daysPerMonth → DAYS_PER_MONTH constant (30.5)`. Editable in Company Assumptions under "Model Constants" with governed field wrappers. All engine files (`resolve-assumptions.ts`, `property-engine.ts`), server checker files, and client audit files use the cascade.

---
