/**
 * cashFlowAggregator — GAAP indirect-method yearly cash flow builder
 *
 * Single source of truth for YearlyCashFlowResult[] — consumed by
 * YearlyCashFlowStatement, excelExport, and PropertyDetail.
 *
 * All debt service, depreciation, tax, and refinance values are read directly
 * from the engine's MonthlyFinancials — nothing is recomputed here.
 * This eliminates the dual-path problem where statement and export rows
 * diverged because exports independently re-derived these values.
 *
 * GAAP indirect method (ASC 230):
 *   Operating CF  = Net Income + Depreciation add-back
 *   Financing CF  = -Principal + Refinancing Proceeds
 *   Cash from ops = Operating CF (working capital change modeled as 0)
 *
 * Exit year annualization: in the final year the exit sale proceeds are
 * added to the last-year cash flow. The function caller is responsible
 * for computing and passing those proceeds separately.
