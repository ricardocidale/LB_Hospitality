/**
 * fix-shared-ownership.ts — One-time data fixup
 *
 * Corrects a historical seeding bug where properties and global_assumptions
 * were created with userId = adminUserId instead of userId = NULL. Non-null
 * userId makes data invisible to other authenticated users because the
 * storage layer queries `WHERE userId = :uid OR userId IS NULL`.
 *
 * Safe to run on every startup — it's a no-op if data is already correct.
