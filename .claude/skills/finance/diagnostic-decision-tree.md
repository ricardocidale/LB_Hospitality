# Financial Diagnostic Decision Tree

## Before You Grep

1. Run `npm run verify:summary` — check which identities fail
2. Run `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/operating-reserve-cash.test.ts` — 13 core guards
3. Check browser console for NaN/Infinity warnings in financial components
4. Read the ADVERSE finding text — it names the broken identity

## Symptom → Root Cause → Fix

### 1. NaN in NOI or Net Income

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Missing property assumption | `shared/schema.ts` | Nullable field without `?? 0` fallback |
| Division by zero | `financialEngine.ts` | `/ roomCount` or `/ occupancy` when property has 0 rooms or 0% |
| Undefined month index | `financialEngine.ts` | Off-by-one in monthly loop (`month - 1` vs `month`) |

**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/` — any NaN propagates to multiple failures.

### 2. Balance Sheet Imbalance (A ≠ L + E)

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Retained earnings not accumulating | `financialEngine.ts` | `retainedEarnings += netIncome` missing or sign-flipped |
| Debt balance drift | `loanCalculations.ts` | Principal payment not reducing outstanding balance |
| Missing equity posting | `financialEngine.ts` | Initial equity contribution not posted to BS |
| Refinance not swapping debt | `financialEngine.ts` | Old loan not zeroed when new loan starts |

**Identity:** `Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity` (Identity #11)
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/proof/golden-values.test.ts`

### 3. Cash Flow ≠ Change in Cash

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Principal on income statement | `financialEngine.ts` | Principal must be financing activity only (ASC 470) |
| Depreciation not added back | `financialEngine.ts` | Operating CF = Net Income + Depreciation |
| Missing refinance proceeds | `financialEngine.ts` | Refi proceeds must appear in financing CF |
| Operating reserve not seeded | `financialEngine.ts` | Reserve seeds ending cash at acquisition month |

**Identity:** `Operating CF + Financing CF = Total Cash Flow` (Identity #9)
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/operating-reserve-cash.test.ts`

### 4. Wrong Management Fees

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Fee rate from wrong source | `financialEngine.ts` | Must use `property.managementFeeRate ?? DEFAULT_*` |
| Incentive fee threshold | `financialEngine.ts` | Only applies above GOP threshold |
| Zero-sum violation | `financialEngine.ts` | Σ(property fee expense) must = company fee revenue |

**Identity:** `Σ(Property Fee Expense) = Management Company Fee Revenue` (Identity #18)
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/per-property-fees.test.ts`

### 5. Negative Cash Balance

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Pre-ops debt payments | `financialEngine.ts` | Gap between acquisition and operations start |
| Operating reserve missing | `financialEngine.ts` | Reserve must cover pre-revenue debt service |
| Funding gate skipped | `funding-predictor.ts` | Company ops can't start before SAFE funding |

**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/operating-reserve-cash.test.ts`

### 6. IRR Returns Infinity or NaN

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Zero equity invested | `financialEngine.ts` | Equity = 0 makes IRR undefined |
| No sign change in cash flows | `financialEngine.ts` | IRR needs negative then positive flows |
| Exit value missing | `financialEngine.ts` | Exit proceeds not added to final period |

**Identity:** `NPV at IRR = 0` (Identity #22)
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/` (IRR tests)

### 7. FCFE Direct ≠ FCFE Indirect

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Depreciation mismatch | `financialEngine.ts` | Direct: NOI − DS − Tax + Refi; Indirect: NI + Dep − Princ + Refi |
| Tax calculation | `financialEngine.ts` | Tax = max(0, taxable income × rate) — NOL may differ |
| Refinance double-count | `financialEngine.ts` | Refi proceeds in both paths but only once each |

**Identity:** FCFE Direct = FCFE Indirect (Identity #19 = #20)
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/proof/reconciliation-report.test.ts`

### 8. Verification Shows ADVERSE

| Finding Text | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| "Balance sheet does not balance" | See Symptom #2 | Fix A=L+E identity |
| "Cash flow does not reconcile" | See Symptom #3 | Fix CF = ΔCash |
| "FCFE methods diverge" | See Symptom #7 | Reconcile direct/indirect |
| "Hardcoded value detected" | Literal in calc path | Replace with `DEFAULT_*` constant |
| "Fee zero-sum violation" | See Symptom #4 | Fix intercompany elimination |
| "Recalculation not triggered" | Missing `invalidateAllFinancialQueries` | Add to mutation's `onSuccess` |

### 9. Hardcoded Value Detected

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Literal in engine | `financialEngine.ts` | Raw number instead of `DEFAULT_*` constant |
| Missing constant | `shared/constants.ts` | Value exists in code but not as named constant |
| Fallback without constant | Any calc file | `?? 0.03` instead of `?? DEFAULT_INFLATION_RATE` |

**Exceptions:** Only `DEPRECIATION_YEARS (27.5)` and `DAYS_PER_MONTH (30.5)` are allowed literals.
**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/proof/hardcoded-detection.test.ts`

### 10. Refinance Math Wrong

| Check | File | What to Look For |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Old loan not retired | `financialEngine.ts` | Outstanding balance must zero at refi month |
| Pass 2 not rebuilding | `financialEngine.ts` | Refi triggers full recalc from refi month |
| Reserve not re-seeded | `financialEngine.ts` | Operating reserve re-seeds at acquisition month in Pass 2 |
| Per-property fields | `financialEngine.ts` | Must use `property.refiInterestRate`, not `debtAssumptions.*` |

**Quick test:** `npm run test:file -- tests/engine/operating-reserve-cash.test.ts`

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Full verification (shows which identities fail)
npm run verify:summary

# All engine tests (fastest broad check)
npm run test:file -- tests/engine/

# All proof tests (invariant enforcement)
npm run test:file -- tests/proof/

# Specific guard tests
npm run test:file -- tests/engine/operating-reserve-cash.test.ts  # 13 core guards
npm run test:file -- tests/engine/per-property-fees.test.ts       # Fee zero-sum
npm run test:file -- tests/proof/golden-values.test.ts            # Golden scenarios
npm run test:file -- tests/proof/hardcoded-detection.test.ts      # No literals
npm run test:file -- tests/proof/recalculation-enforcement.test.ts # Invalidation

# Full health check (TS + tests + verify + doc harmony)
npm run health
```
