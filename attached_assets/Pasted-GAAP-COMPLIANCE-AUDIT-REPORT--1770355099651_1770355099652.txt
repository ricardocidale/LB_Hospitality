  CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Must Fix)

  1. FF&E Reserve Classified as Operating Expense (ASC 360 / USALI)

  financialEngine.ts:336,350,354
  - FF&E is treated as an operating expense included in totalOperatingExpenses (line 350) AND subtracted again from GOP (line 354)
  - USALI requires FF&E reserve to be a capital expenditure below NOI, not an operating expense
  - Impact: NOI understated, GOP distorted, management fees calculated on wrong base
  - Double-count: FF&E is subtracted twice (once in operating expenses, once from GOP)

  2. Land Value Included in Depreciation Base (ASC 360-10-30)

  financialEngine.ts:241-242, loanCalculations.ts:118-119
  - buildingValue = purchasePrice + buildingImprovements — land is not depreciable but is included
  - No landValue field exists in the property model
  - Impact: Depreciation overstated by ~20-25% (typical land allocation) for the life of the asset

  3. Pre-Acquisition Properties Consolidated in Revenue (ASC 810)

  Dashboard.tsx:93-159 (getYearlyConsolidated)
  - All properties are summed for all years regardless of acquisition date
  - No check for acquisitionDate < yearStart before including property revenue
  - ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:86 does this correctly, but Dashboard does not
  - Impact: Consolidated revenue overstated in years before all properties are acquired

  4. Inter-Company Management Fees Not Eliminated (ASC 810)

  financialEngine.ts:345,354 vs financialEngine.ts:549-551
  - Properties deduct management fees as expense (reduces NOI)
  - Company recognizes the same fees as revenue
  - In any consolidated view, these should net to zero — currently they don't
  - Impact: Consolidated statements double-count the economic impact of fees

  5. Cash Flow cashFlow Variable Double-Deducts Interest (ASC 230)

  financialEngine.ts:389-390
  netIncome = noi - interestExpense     // Line 389 - interest deducted
  cashFlow = noi - debtPayment          // Line 390 - FULL debt payment deducted (interest + principal)
  - cashFlow deducts interest via debtPayment but netIncome already deducted it separately
  - These two fields are inconsistent: cashFlow is effectively netIncome - principalPayment + interestExpense - debtPayment
  - Impact: The cashFlow field and netIncome field use different methodologies in the same output object

  6. Income Tax Missing from Core Monthly Engine (ASC 740)

  financialEngine.ts:389
  - netIncome = noi - interestExpense — no income tax deducted
  - Depreciation tax shield is never applied in the monthly engine
  - Tax only appears in Dashboard.tsx and loanCalculations.ts, not in the authoritative monthly financials
  - Impact: Monthly net income is overstated; tax liability not tracked monthly

  7. Depreciation Tax Shield Not Applied (ASC 740)

  financialEngine.ts:389,393
  - depreciationExpense is calculated (line 393) and stored but never used in net income calculation
  - GAAP requires: Taxable Income = NOI - Interest - Depreciation, then Tax = max(0, taxable) × rate
  - Impact: If tax were applied, the depreciation shield would reduce taxable income — currently both are missing

  ---
  HIGH SEVERITY (Should Fix)

  8. No Depreciation Cap at Depreciable Base (ASC 360)

  financialEngine.ts:394, ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:112
  - accumulatedDepreciation = monthlyDepreciation * (monthsSinceAcquisition + 1) — no upper bound
  - After 27.5 years (330 months), accumulated depreciation would exceed cost basis
  - Fix: Math.min(accumulatedDepreciation, depreciableBasis)

  9. No Current vs Long-Term Debt Classification (ASC 470)

  ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:232-243
  - All debt shown as "Long-Term Liabilities"
  - GAAP requires principal due within 12 months classified as current
  - Impact: Current ratio and working capital metrics are wrong

  10. No Interest Payable on Balance Sheet (ASC 835)

  ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:165
  - totalLiabilities = totalDebtOutstanding — only principal, no accrued interest
  - If interest accrues monthly but payments are made differently, there's a timing gap
  - Impact: Liabilities understated, balance sheet equation may not hold

  11. Debt Closing Costs Expensed Instead of Capitalized (ASC 470-50)

  loanCalculations.ts:238-241
  - Closing costs are deducted from refinance proceeds as a cash reduction
  - GAAP requires them capitalized as a contra-liability and amortized over the loan term using effective interest method
  - Impact: No amortization of closing costs; balance sheet doesn't show unamortized debt issuance costs

  12. No Gain/Loss on Sale Calculated (ASC 360-10)

  Dashboard.tsx:3324-3336
  - Exit returns net proceeds (sale price - commission - debt), but never calculates:
  Gain/Loss = Sale Price - Book Value - Selling Costs
  where Book Value = Original Cost - Accumulated Depreciation
  - Impact: No audit trail for disposition gain/loss; tax implications unknown

  13. No Refinance Extinguishment Accounting (ASC 470-50-40)

  loanCalculations.ts:275-284
  - On refinance, old debt balance switches to new debt balance
  - No gain/loss on extinguishment recorded
  - No treatment of unamortized closing costs on old debt
  - Impact: Period income is misstated in the refinance year

  14. Incentive Fee on GOP Without Hurdle Rate

  financialEngine.ts:353
  - feeIncentive = Math.max(0, gop * global.incentiveManagementFee)
  - Industry standard HMAs (Hotel Management Agreements) require an owner's priority return (typically 6-8% on equity) before incentive fees kick in
  - Impact: Incentive fees overstated; owner returns understated

  15. Dashboard Depreciation Ignores Per-Property Acquisition Dates

  Dashboard.tsx:942
  - accumulatedDepreciation = (totalPropertyValue / DEPRECIATION_YEARS) * Math.min(yearIndex + 1, projectionYears)
  - Applies same years-of-depreciation to ALL properties
  - ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:110-112 handles this correctly per property
  - Impact: Balance sheet book values wrong when properties acquired at different times

  16. SAFE Funding in Operating Cash Flow (ASC 230)

  Company.tsx:280-283
  - SAFE proceeds lumped with revenue in "Cash Inflows"
  - Per ASC 230, SAFE funding is a financing activity
  - Impact: Operating cash flow overstated

  17. Company Cash Flow Statement Missing Three-Section Format (ASC 230)

  Company.tsx:1110-1447
  - No formal Operating / Investing / Financing sections
  - SAFE funding, revenue, and expenses all mixed together
  - Impact: Non-compliant cash flow presentation

  ---
  MEDIUM SEVERITY

  18. Working Capital Hard-Coded to Zero (ASC 230)

  financialEngine.ts:431-433
  - workingCapitalChange = 0 — hotels have material A/R (group bookings), A/P (suppliers), and guest deposits
  - Impact: Operating cash flow approximation; acceptable if disclosed but material for event-heavy properties

  19. No Mid-Month Depreciation Proration (ASC 360)

  financialEngine.ts:393
  - Full month's depreciation taken in acquisition month regardless of acquisition date within the month
  - Impact: Depreciation overstated by up to ~50% in first month

  20. Accumulated Depreciation Off-by-One (ASC 360)

  financialEngine.ts:394
  - monthlyDepreciation * (monthsSinceAcquisition + 1) — the +1 means depreciation starts accumulating in month 0
  - Impact: Book value understated by one month's depreciation throughout projection

  21. Portfolio Metrics Include Unacquired Properties

  Dashboard.tsx:184-217
  - Weighted ADR/occupancy/RevPAR denominator includes room-nights from properties not yet acquired
  - Impact: Portfolio metrics distorted in early years

  22. Retained Earnings Don't Eliminate Inter-Company Fees

  ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx:140-150
  - cumulativeNOI is post-management-fee, so retained earnings is understated by cumulative management fees
  - In consolidated view, those fees should be added back

  23. SAFE Notes Classified as Debt (ASC 480)

  Company.tsx:1519
  - SAFE shown as "SAFE Notes Payable" (liability)
  - SAFEs are typically mezzanine equity or contingent consideration, not pure debt
  - No modeling of conversion to equity

  24. Partner Compensation vs Distribution Ambiguity (ASC 505)

  financialEngine.ts:593, Company.tsx:217
  - Partner compensation treated as operating expense
  - If these are profit distributions (not service compensation), they should reduce equity, not hit the P&L
  - Impact: Net income understated if these are distributions

  25. No Impairment Testing (ASC 360-10-35)

  - No code compares carrying value to fair value
  - If a property's NOI declines significantly, book value could exceed recoverable amount
  - Impact: Assets potentially overstated

  INCOME STATEMENT STRUCTURE (USALI Non-Compliance)

  The correct USALI flow should be:
  Total Revenue
  - Departmental Expenses (Rooms, F&B, Events)
  = Departmental Profit
  - Undistributed Expenses (Admin, Marketing, IT, Utilities, Insurance, Taxes, Property Ops)
  = Gross Operating Profit (GOP)
  - Management Fees (Base + Incentive)
  = Adjusted GOP
  - FF&E Reserve (Capital Item)
  = Net Operating Income (NOI)
  - Interest Expense
  - Depreciation
  - Income Tax
  = Net Income

  Current model flow (financialEngine.ts):
  Total Revenue
  - ALL Operating Expenses (including FF&E as operating)  ← WRONG
  = GOP (understated by FF&E)
  - Management Fees (base on revenue, incentive on GOP)
  - FF&E (deducted AGAIN)  ← DOUBLE COUNT
  = NOI (significantly understated)
  - Interest Expense
  = Net Income (no tax, no depreciation impact)  ← INCOMPLETE
