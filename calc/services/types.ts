/**
 * types.ts — Centralized Services Type Definitions
 *
 * Defines the data structures for the cost-plus centralized services model.
 * The management company can provide services to properties in two modes:
 *   - Centralized: company procures externally, charges property at cost + markup
 *   - Direct: property handles directly, company earns oversight fee (no cost-of-service)
 *
 * Used by the margin calculator, cost-of-services aggregator, and the financial engine.
