/**
 * calc/refinance/types.ts — TypeScript type definitions for the Refinance Calculator.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Defines every input, output, and intermediate type used by the refinance
 * calculation skill. Refinancing replaces an existing (acquisition) loan with a
 * new loan, typically to extract equity, secure a lower rate, or reset the
 * amortization schedule. This module captures all the data needed to model that
 * transaction, including prepayment penalties, DSCR-based sizing, and the
 * resulting journal entries.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * The refinance calculator (`calc/refinance/refinance-calculator.ts`) imports
 * these types. It is invoked by the financial engine when a property's timeline
 * includes a refinance event. The outputs feed into the property's debt service
 * schedule, cash flow statement, and balance sheet.
 *
 * KEY FINANCIAL CONCEPTS:
 *
 * Prepayment Penalty — a fee charged by the lender for paying off a loan early.
 *   Three common structures in commercial real estate:
 *   - "none": No penalty (rare in fixed-rate CRE loans).
 *   - "pct_of_balance": A flat percentage of the outstanding principal (e.g., 2%).
 *   - "fixed": A fixed dollar amount regardless of balance.
 *
 * Property Valuation — determines the maximum new loan size via LTV. Two paths:
 *   - "direct": The borrower provides an appraised or agreed-upon value.
 *   - "noi_cap": Value = Stabilized NOI / Cap Rate. This is the income approach
 *     to valuation, the most common method in hospitality.
 *
 * LTV (Loan-to-Value) — New Loan Amount / Property Value. Lenders cap this
 *   (e.g., 65–75%) to maintain a cushion against value declines.
 *
 * DSCR Binding — If NOI is insufficient to cover debt service at the LTV-implied
 *   loan amount (DSCR < minimum, typically 1.25×), the loan is sized down to
 *   the DSCR-constrained maximum instead. The `dscr_binding` flag indicates this.
 *
 * Cash-Out to Equity — After paying off the old loan, prepayment penalty,
 *   accrued interest, and new closing costs, any remaining proceeds go to the
 *   equity holders. If negative, the borrower must contribute additional equity.
 *
 * Journal Hooks — Double-entry accounting entries (JournalDelta[]) generated at
 *   refinance to keep the balance sheet in balance: derecognize old debt, record
 *   new debt, book closing costs, and distribute cash-out proceeds.
 *   (See ASC 470-50 for debt modification/extinguishment guidance.)
