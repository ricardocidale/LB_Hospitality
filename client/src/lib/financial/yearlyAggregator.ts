/**
 * yearlyAggregator — Monthly-to-yearly rollup for property financials
 *
 * Single source of truth replacing 6 independent implementations across
 * Dashboard, PropertyDetail, YearlyIncomeStatement, YearlyCashFlowStatement,
 * and excelExport that each reimplemented the same slice-and-reduce pattern.
 *
 * Two aggregation strategies are used:
 *   SUM fields   — revenue, expenses, NOI, debt service, cash flows: monthly
 *                  values are summed to produce the annual total.
 *   PICK_LAST    — endingCash: the December (last month) value of the year is
 *                  used because cash is a stock, not a flow. Summing it would
 *                  produce a nonsensical running total × 12.
 *   DERIVED      — expenseUtilities = expenseUtilitiesVar + expenseUtilitiesFixed
 *                  (computed after accumulation, not a raw engine field).
 *   PICK_LAST ADR — cleanAdr is the last non-zero ADR in the year (end-of-year
 *                  rate, not a blended average).
 *
 * Empty years (yearData.length === 0) are skipped entirely via `continue`.
 *
 * Optimized: uses direct index arithmetic instead of data.slice() to avoid
 * intermediate array allocations per year.
