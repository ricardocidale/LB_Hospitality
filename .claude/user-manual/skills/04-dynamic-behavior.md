## Section ID: `dynamic-behavior`

## Content Summary
Explains the real-time recalculation engine and multi-level analysis:

### Real-Time Recalculation
- Change any assumption → entire financial model recalculates instantly
- No "run" button needed — projections update on every input change
- Monthly granularity (30.5-day months) rolled up to yearly for presentation

### Multi-Level Analysis
1. **Property Level** — Individual hotel P&L, balance sheet, cash flow
2. **Company Level** — Management company overhead, staffing, partner compensation
3. **Portfolio Level** — Aggregated view across all properties + management company
4. **Consolidated Level** — Full consolidation with intercompany eliminations

### System Goals
- Transparent: every number traceable to inputs
- Auditable: independent verification system validates all calculations
- Standards-compliant: GAAP (ASC 230, 360, 470, 606) and USALI
