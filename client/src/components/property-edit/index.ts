/**
 * property-edit/index.ts
 *
 * Barrel export for the property assumptions editor.
 * These seven section components are rendered together on the "Edit Property"
 * page, which lets users configure every financial input for a single hotel
 * property — from basic info (name, rooms, ADR) through capital structure,
 * revenue, operating costs, management fees, and exit assumptions.
 *
 * Each section receives a shared `PropertyEditSectionProps` contract (see
 * types.ts) so the parent page can pass the draft property object, a global
 * assumptions fallback, and an `onChange` handler that writes back to the
 * optimistic draft before persisting.
