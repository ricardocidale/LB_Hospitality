          Each formula follows the engine's income statement waterfall:
          Revenue → Operating Expenses → GOP → Management Fees → AGOP → Property Taxes → NOI → FF&E → ANOI.
          Industry ranges are drawn from USALI 12th Edition, HVS 2024 specialty/wellness fee surveys,
          IRS Publication 946, and Global Wellness Institute benchmarks.
