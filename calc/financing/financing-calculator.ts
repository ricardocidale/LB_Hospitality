/**
 * calc/financing/financing-calculator.ts — Main entry point for the Acquisition Financing Calculator.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Orchestrates the full acquisition financing workflow: validates inputs, sizes the
 * loan (via LTV or override), computes closing costs, calculates equity required,
 * builds the monthly debt service schedule, and generates GAAP-compliant journal
 * entries for loan origination. This is "Skill 1" in the calculation engine's
 * skill taxonomy.
 *
 * PIPELINE (7 steps):
 *   1. Validate — Reject impossible inputs (negative rates, zero purchase price, etc.)
 *   2. Size the loan — Apply LTV cap or use the explicit override amount
 *   3. Closing costs — Percentage-based + fixed fees
 *   4. Net loan proceeds — Gross loan minus closing costs
 *   5. Equity required — purchase_price + closing_costs + reserves − net_proceeds
 *   6. Build schedule — Monthly amortization table (interest, principal, balance)
 *   7. Journal hooks — Double-entry entries for the balance sheet at origination
 *
 * GAAP INVARIANTS ENFORCED:
 * - Closing costs are deferred (capitalized) per ASC 310-20, not immediately expensed.
 * - Only interest expense hits the Income Statement; principal payments reduce the
 *   loan liability on the Balance Sheet and appear in Financing Cash Flow (ASC 470).
 * - Equity contributions flow through equity accounts, never the Income Statement.
 * - The amortization schedule is self-consistent: ending_balance = beginning_balance − principal.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * The financial engine calls `computeFinancing()` once per property at the acquisition
 * date. The returned schedule populates monthly debt service rows, and the journal
 * hooks ensure the balance sheet is initialized correctly on day one.
