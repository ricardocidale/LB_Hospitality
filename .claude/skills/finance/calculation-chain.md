## 1. Revenue Calculations

### Source: STR (Smith Travel Research) Industry Standards

| Formula | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Available Rooms | `roomCount × 30.5` | Industry standard (30.5 days/month) |
| Sold Rooms | `availableRooms × occupancy` | STR methodology |
| Room Revenue | `soldRooms × ADR` | STR: ADR = Total Room Revenue ÷ Rooms Sold |
| RevPAR | `ADR × occupancy` or `roomRevenue ÷ availableRooms` | STR: both methods must agree |
| F&B Revenue | `roomRevenue × revShareFB × (1 + cateringBoostPercent)` | L+B model |
| Events Revenue | `roomRevenue × revShareEvents` | L+B model |
| Other Revenue | `roomRevenue × revShareOther` | L+B model |
| Total Revenue | `roomRevenue + fbRevenue + eventsRevenue + otherRevenue` | USALI Summary Statement |

### ADR Growth
```
currentADR = startADR × (1 + adrGrowthRate) ^ opsYear
```
Where `opsYear = floor(monthsSinceOps / 12)`. Growth compounds annually from operations start.

### Occupancy Ramp
```
occupancy = min(maxOccupancy, startOccupancy + (rampSteps × occupancyGrowthStep))
rampSteps = floor(monthsSinceOps / occupancyRampMonths)
```

### Assumption Variables → Revenue
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `startAdr` | Room Revenue, all ancillary revenues (via ratios) |
| `adrGrowthRate` | Year-over-year Room Revenue growth |
| `startOccupancy` | Sold Rooms → Room Revenue |
| `maxOccupancy` | Ceiling on occupancy ramp |
| `occupancyRampMonths` | Speed of occupancy ramp |
| `occupancyGrowthStep` | Size of each occupancy increase |
| `roomCount` | Available Rooms → capacity |
| `revShareFB` | F&B Revenue as % of Room Revenue |
| `revShareEvents` | Events Revenue as % of Room Revenue |
| `revShareOther` | Other Revenue as % of Room Revenue |
| `cateringBoostPercent` | F&B multiplier for catering |

## 2. Operating Expenses

### Source: USALI 12th Edition (effective Jan 1, 2026)

USALI classifies expenses into two categories:

**Variable Costs** — scale with current revenue:
```
expenseRooms       = roomRevenue × costRateRooms
expenseFB          = fbRevenue × costRateFB
expenseEvents      = eventsRevenue × eventExpenseRate
expenseOther       = otherRevenue × otherExpenseRate
expenseMarketing   = totalRevenue × costRateMarketing
expenseUtilitiesVar = totalRevenue × (costRateUtilities × utilitiesVariableSplit)
expenseFFE         = totalRevenue × costRateFFE
```

**Fixed Costs** — anchored to Year 1 base revenue, escalate independently (per USALI):
```
baseDollar = baseMonthlyTotalRevenue × costRate
fixedCostFactor = (1 + fixedCostEscalationRate) ^ opsYear
fixedExpense = baseDollar × fixedCostFactor
```

Fixed cost line items: Admin, Property Ops, IT, Insurance, Taxes, Fixed Utilities, Other Costs.

**Total Operating Expenses** = sum of all variable + fixed expenses.

### Assumption Variables → Expenses
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `costRateRooms` | Rooms department expense |
| `costRateFB` | F&B department expense |
| `costRateAdmin` | Admin expense (fixed) |
| `costRateMarketing` | Marketing expense (variable) |
| `costRatePropertyOps` | Property operations (fixed) |
| `costRateUtilities` | Utilities expense (split variable/fixed) |
| `costRateInsurance` | Insurance expense (fixed) |
| `costRateTaxes` | Property tax expense (fixed) |
| `costRateIT` | IT expense (fixed) |
| `costRateFFE` | FF&E reserve (variable) |
| `costRateOther` | Other costs (fixed) |
| `utilitiesVariableSplit` | Split between variable/fixed utilities |
| `fixedCostEscalationRate` | Annual escalation for fixed costs |
| `inflationRate` | Fallback escalation rate |
| `eventExpenseRate` | Events department expense rate |
| `otherExpenseRate` | Other department expense rate |

## 3. Profitability Metrics

### Source: USALI 12th Edition

```
GOP = Total Revenue − Total Operating Expenses
```

GOP = Gross Operating Profit = "Income Before Fixed Charges" per USALI.

```
NOI = GOP − Base Management Fee − Incentive Management Fee − FF&E Reserve
```

Where:
- `baseMgmtFee = totalRevenue × baseManagementFee`
- `incentiveMgmtFee = max(0, GOP × incentiveManagementFee)`
- FF&E Reserve = `totalRevenue × costRateFFE`

**Note on USALI alignment:** The engine combines management fees and FF&E in the NOI calculation. Per strict USALI, NOI = GOP − Mgmt Fees − Fixed Charges. Our engine treats FF&E as an operating expense deducted at the NOI level, which is acceptable for pro forma modeling (FF&E is not a GAAP expense but a contractual/covenant item).

### Assumption Variables → Profitability
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `baseManagementFee` | Base fee deducted from GOP → NOI |
| `incentiveManagementFee` | Incentive fee deducted from GOP → NOI |

---

## 4. Depreciation

### Source: IRS Publication 946 (2024), ASC 360-10

**Method:** MACRS straight-line, 27.5-year recovery period for residential rental property.

**Convention:** Mid-month convention required by IRS.

```
depreciableBasis = purchasePrice × (1 − landValuePercent) + buildingImprovements
monthlyDepreciation = depreciableBasis / 27.5 / 12
```

**Land never depreciates** (IRS Publication 946, Section 3). Land is separated using `landValuePercent` (default 25%).

**Current engine simplification:** Uses simple straight-line (`basis / 27.5 / 12`) for every month post-acquisition. The IRS mid-month convention would prorate the first and last year based on month placed in service. This is a known simplification acceptable for pro forma modeling but would need adjustment for tax filing.

### IRS Mid-Month Convention First-Year Rates (27.5-year residential):
| Month Placed in Service | Year 1 Rate |
|------------------------|-------------|
| January | 3.485% |
| February | 3.182% |
| March | 2.879% |
| April | 2.576% |
| May | 2.273% |
| June | 1.970% |
| July | 1.667% |
| August | 1.364% |
| September | 1.061% |
| October | 0.758% |
| November | 0.455% |
| December | 0.152% |
| Years 2–27 | 3.636% |
| Year 28 | Remainder |

### Assumption Variables → Depreciation
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `purchasePrice` | Depreciable basis |
| `landValuePercent` | Non-depreciable portion (default 25%) |
| `buildingImprovements` | Added to depreciable basis |
| `acquisitionDate` | When depreciation starts |

## 5. Debt Service (Loan Amortization)

### Source: ASC 470 (Debt), Standard Amortization Formula

**Monthly Payment (PMT):**
```
PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n − 1]

Where:
  P = loan amount (purchasePrice × LTV for financed properties)
  r = annual interest rate / 12
  n = term in years × 12
```

**For zero interest rate:** `PMT = P / n` (straight-line principal reduction).

**Monthly Interest/Principal Split:**
```
interestExpense = remainingBalance × monthlyRate
principalPayment = PMT − interestExpense
newBalance = remainingBalance − principalPayment
```

### ASC 470 Treatment (GAAP)
- **Interest expense** → Income Statement (operating expense)
- **Principal payment** → Balance Sheet (liability reduction) + Cash Flow Statement (financing activity)
- Interest and principal are NEVER combined as a single expense on the Income Statement

### Assumption Variables → Debt Service
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `acquisitionLTV` | Loan amount = purchasePrice × LTV |
| `acquisitionInterestRate` | Monthly interest and PMT calculation |
| `acquisitionTermYears` | Loan amortization period |
| `type` ("Financed" vs "Cash") | Whether debt service applies at all |

---

## 6. Net Income

### Source: GAAP Income Statement

```
taxableIncome = NOI − interestExpense − depreciationExpense
incomeTax = max(0, taxableIncome × taxRate)
netIncome = NOI − interestExpense − depreciationExpense − incomeTax
```

**Key GAAP rules:**
- Only interest expense hits the Income Statement (ASC 470)
- Depreciation is a non-cash expense on the Income Statement (ASC 360)
- Income tax only applies when taxable income is positive
- Principal payment does NOT appear on Income Statement

### Assumption Variables → Net Income
| Assumption | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| `taxRate` | Income tax calculation |
| All revenue/expense assumptions | Through NOI |
| All debt assumptions | Through interest expense |
| All depreciation assumptions | Through depreciation expense |

---

## 7. Cash Flow Statement

### Source: ASC 230 — Statement of Cash Flows (Indirect Method)

```
Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation
  (add back non-cash depreciation expense)

Financing Cash Flow = −Principal Payment + Refinancing Proceeds
  (principal is a financing activity, not operating)

Total Cash Flow = NOI − Total Debt Payment − Income Tax
  (direct calculation for verification)

Verification: Operating CF + Financing CF = Total Cash Flow
  i.e., (NI + Dep) + (−Principal + Refi) = NOI − DebtPayment − Tax + Refi
```

**Cumulative Cash:**
```
endingCash[month] = endingCash[month−1] + cashFlow[month]
```

### Key ASC 230 Requirements
1. Must start from Net Income (not NOI or operating income)
2. Add back all non-cash items (depreciation)
3. Interest paid classified as operating activity (default GAAP)
4. Principal payments classified as financing activity
5. Refinancing proceeds classified as financing activity

---

## 8. Balance Sheet

### Source: GAAP Fundamental Equation

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

**Assets:**
```
propertyValue = landValue + (buildingValue − accumulatedDepreciation)
  where landValue = purchasePrice × landValuePercent
  where buildingValue = purchasePrice × (1 − landValuePercent) + buildingImprovements
  where accumulatedDepreciation = monthlyDepreciation × monthsSinceAcquisition
totalAssets = propertyValue + endingCash
```

**Liabilities:**
```
totalLiabilities = debtOutstanding
```

**Equity:**
```
totalEquity = totalAssets − totalLiabilities
```

---

## 9. Financing Analysis Calculators

### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
**Source:** JP Morgan CRE Lending, Industry Standard
```
DSCR = Annual NOI ÷ Annual Debt Service
```
- Minimum for hotels: 1.30–1.50x
- Debt service includes both principal and interest

### Max Loan from DSCR
```
maxAnnualDebtService = NOI ÷ requiredDSCR
maxLoanAmount = PV(monthlyRate, termMonths, −maxMonthlyPayment)
```

### Debt Yield
**Source:** Wall Street Prep, CRE Lending Standards
```
debtYield = NOI ÷ loanAmount × 100
```
- Minimum for most lenders: 10%
- Rate-independent and term-independent risk measure

### Max Loan from Debt Yield
```
maxLoan = NOI ÷ requiredDebtYield
```

---

## 10. Refinance

### Source: ASC 470-50 (Debt Modifications/Extinguishments)

```
propertyValue = stabilizedNOI ÷ exitCapRate
newLoanAmount = propertyValue × refinanceLTV
closingCosts = newLoanAmount × closingCostRate
netProceeds = newLoanAmount − closingCosts − existingDebtBalance
cashToEquity = max(0, netProceeds)
```

Post-refinance: new loan amortization schedule replaces old schedule from refinance month onward. NOI is debt-independent, so Pass 1 values for revenue/expenses/NOI remain correct.

---

## 11. IRR (Internal Rate of Return)

### Source: CFA Institute, Wall Street Prep

```
0 = Σ [CFt / (1 + IRR)^t] − C0
```

Solved iteratively (Newton-Raphson or bisection method).

For real estate:
- CF0 = −(equity investment) = −(purchasePrice − loanAmount + closingCosts)
- CF1..n = annual FCFE (free cash flow to equity)
- CFn includes exit proceeds: salePrice − outstandingDebt − sellingCosts

### FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity)
**Source:** Corporate Finance Institute
```
FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation − CapEx − Principal Repayment + Net Borrowing
```
For our model (no CapEx or working capital changes):
```
FCFE = Cash Flow = NOI − Total Debt Service − Income Tax
```

---

## 12. Management Company

### Revenue
```
baseFeeRevenue = Σ(property.totalRevenue) × baseManagementFee
incentiveFeeRevenue = max(0, Σ(property.GOP) × incentiveManagementFee)
totalRevenue = baseFeeRevenue + incentiveFeeRevenue
```

### Expenses (after company operations start)
Fixed costs escalate at `fixedCostEscalationRate`:
- Partner compensation (yearly schedule, divided by 12)
- Staff compensation (FTE × salary × escalation / 12)
- Office lease, professional services, tech infrastructure, business insurance

Variable costs escalate at `inflationRate`:
- Travel costs (per active property)
- IT licensing (per active property)

Revenue-linked:
- Marketing = totalRevenue × marketingRate
- Misc Ops = totalRevenue × miscOpsRate

### Net Income
```
netIncome = totalRevenue − totalExpenses
cashFlow = netIncome + safeFunding
```
