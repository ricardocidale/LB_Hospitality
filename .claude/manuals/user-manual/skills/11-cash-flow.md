# Chapter 11: Free Cash Flow

The cash flow statement is where the model brings together operating performance, capital expenditures, and financing activities into a single view of how cash moves through the business. The platform follows the GAAP indirect method prescribed by ASC 230 for presenting cash flows.

## Three-Section Structure

The cash flow statement is organized into three sections, each capturing a different category of cash movement:

**Operating Activities** begins with net income and adds back non-cash charges. The primary adjustment is depreciation — a real expense for accounting purposes but one that does not consume cash. Operating cash flow therefore equals net income plus depreciation.

**Investing Activities** captures capital expenditures such as building improvements or major renovations. In the base model, investing activity is limited to the initial property acquisition; ongoing capital needs are addressed through the FF&E reserve.

**Financing Activities** includes all cash flows related to debt and equity. This section records principal payments (which reduce cash), new debt proceeds (which increase cash), and refinancing proceeds. The total of all three sections reconciles to the change in the property's cash balance for the period.

## Free Cash Flow

Beyond the formal cash flow statement, the model calculates two measures of free cash flow that are particularly useful for evaluating investment returns:

**Free Cash Flow (FCF)** represents the cash available after all operating expenses and debt service:

**FCF = NOI − Total Debt Service (Interest + Principal)**

**Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)** refines this further to show the cash available specifically to equity holders:

**FCFE = FCF − Additional Principal Payments**

These metrics tell investors how much cash the property generates for distribution after meeting all of its obligations.

## Critical Accounting Rules

Several important rules govern how cash flows are classified:

- Principal repayment is never recorded on the income statement. Under ASC 470, it is strictly a financing activity — reducing the loan balance, not operating profit.
- Depreciation is added back to net income in the operating activities section because, while it reduces reported earnings under ASC 360, it does not represent an actual outflow of cash.
- The total cash flow from all three sections must reconcile exactly to the change in the entity's cash balance from the beginning to the end of each period.
- Cash balances may never go negative, consistent with the model's no-negative-cash business rule.
