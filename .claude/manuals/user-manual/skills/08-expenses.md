# Chapter 8: Operating Expenses

Operating expenses in the model follow the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (USALI), the standard framework for hotel financial reporting. Expenses are divided into two categories: direct departmental costs that are tied to specific revenue streams, and overhead costs that support the property as a whole.

## Direct Departmental Costs

Direct costs are calculated as a percentage of the revenue generated by each department. These costs cover the labor, supplies, and other expenses directly attributable to delivering each service.

| Department | Default Cost Rate |
|-----------|------------------|
| Rooms | 36% of rooms revenue |
| Food & Beverage | 32% of F&B revenue |
| Events | 65% of events revenue |
| Other | 60% of other revenue |

The higher cost rates for events (65%) and other income (60%) reflect the labor-intensive and variable nature of these revenue streams, while the rooms department (36%) benefits from greater operating leverage once a property reaches stabilized occupancy.

## Overhead Costs

Overhead costs — also known as undistributed expenses in USALI terminology — are calculated as a percentage of the property's total revenue. These costs support the property's overall operations regardless of which department generates the revenue.

| Expense Category | Default Rate |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Administrative & General | 8% |
| Marketing | 5% |
| Property Operations & Maintenance | 4% |
| Utilities | 5% |
| Insurance | 2% |
| Property Taxes | 3% |
| Information Technology | 2% |
| FF&E Reserve | 4% |

The FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) reserve is a standard industry practice, setting aside a portion of revenue each year to fund future capital replacements and renovations.

## Utilities: Variable and Fixed Components

Utilities deserve special attention because they behave differently from other expenses. The model splits utility costs into two components:

- **Variable portion (60%)** scales with revenue, reflecting the energy and water consumption that increases with higher occupancy.
- **Fixed portion (40%)** represents the baseline utility costs incurred regardless of occupancy, such as heating common areas and maintaining exterior lighting. This portion escalates at the fixed cost escalation rate rather than tracking revenue.

## Cost Escalation

All operating costs grow over time to reflect inflation and market conditions:

- **Variable costs** escalate at the general inflation rate, compounding annually.
- **Fixed costs** escalate at the fixed cost escalation rate, which defaults to 3% per year.

This dual-escalation approach ensures that the model realistically captures how different types of costs behave over a multi-year projection period.
