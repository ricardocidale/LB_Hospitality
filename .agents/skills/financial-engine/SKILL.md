The technical contract for the deterministic financial calculation engines. Covers the dual-engine architecture (Property Engine + Company Engine), pipeline stages, calc module taxonomy, return metrics, financial statements, consolidated reporting, and TypeScript type contracts. Use this skill whenever working on financial calculations, engine inputs/outputs, pro forma generation, or return metric computation.

## Architecture

Dual-engine system producing GAAP-compliant (ASC 230, ASC 360, ASC 470) monthly/yearly projections with IRS depreciation rules.

### Property Engine (`client/src/lib/financial/property-engine.ts`)
Single-property monthly pro forma. Processes each month sequentially through an 8-step pipeline producing `MonthlyFinancials[]`.

### Company Engine (`client/src/lib/financial/company-engine.ts`)
Management company P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet. Consumes fee linkage from all property SPVs.

### Independent Verification (`server/calculationChecker.ts`)
Server-side checker reimplements all financial math from scratch. Never imports from client engines. Both producing same results = accuracy confirmed.

## Engine Chain

```
gop -> agop -> noi -> anoi
```

### USALI Income Waterfall
```
Total Revenue
  - Departmental Expenses (Rooms, F&B, Events, Other)
  - Undistributed Operating Expenses (Admin, Marketing, Property Ops, Utilities, IT)
  = GOP (Gross Operating Profit)
  - Management Fees (Base Fee + Incentive Fee)
  = AGOP (Adjusted Gross Operating Profit)
  - Property Taxes
  = NOI (Net Operating Income)         [NOI = AGOP - expenseTaxes]
  - FF&E Reserve
  = ANOI (Adjusted Net Operating Income)
  - Interest Expense
  - Depreciation
  - Income Tax (NOL carryforward at 80% cap per IRC section 172)
  = Net Income
```

## Revenue Computation

```
Room Revenue = roomCount x DAYS_PER_MONTH (30.5) x ADR x Occupancy
```

- **ADR:** Compounds at `adrGrowthRate` annually, flat within each year
- **Occupancy:** Ramps from `startOccupancy` in steps, capped at `maxOccupancy`
- **Events Revenue:** `roomRevenue x eventsRevenueShare` (default 30%)
- **F&B Revenue:** `roomRevenue x fbRevenueShare x (1 + cateringBoostPercent)` (default 18% x 1.22)
- **Other Revenue:** `roomRevenue x otherRevenueShare` (default 5%)

## Expense Categories

### Variable Costs (revenue-based)
| Expense | Default Rate | Base |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Rooms (Housekeeping) | 20% | Room Revenue |
| F&B | 9% | F&B Revenue |
| Events | 65% | Events Revenue |
| Other | 60% | Other Revenue |
| Marketing | 1% | Total Revenue |
| FF&E Reserve | 4% | Total Revenue |

### Fixed Costs (Year 1 base, escalated annually)
| Expense | Default Rate | Base |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Admin & General | 8% | Total Revenue |
| Property Ops | 4% | Total Revenue |
| Utilities | 5% (60% variable/40% fixed) | Total Revenue |
| IT | 0.5% | Total Revenue |
| Property Taxes | 3% | Total Property Value / 12 |

Fixed cost escalation: anchored to Year 1 base, escalated by `fixedCostEscalationRate`. Supports annual or monthly compounding via `escalationMethod`.

## Debt Service

- **PMT calculation:** Standard amortization formula from `loanCalculations.ts`
- Interest = balance x monthly rate
- Principal = PMT - Interest
- Loan balance decremented each month
- 100% equity (LTV=0): no debt, no PMT, financing CF = 0

## Depreciation

- **Building:** Straight-line over 27.5 years (IRS residential rental)
- **Monthly:** `buildingValue / 27.5 / 12`
- Only starts after `acquisitionDate`
- Building value = `purchasePrice - landValue` (or `purchasePrice * (1 - landValuePercent)`)

## Refinance

Post-processing step when `willRefinance` is true and `refinanceDate` is within projection:
- New valuation: `stabilized NOI / capRate`
- New loan: `valuation x refi LTV`
- Proceeds = gross loan - closing costs - old balance payoff
- Old loan schedule replaced from refi month forward

## Three Financial Statements

### Income Statement
Revenue through Net Income with all USALI line items.

### Balance Sheet (A = L + E every month)
- **Assets:** Cash, Net Property (building - accumulated depreciation)
- **Liabilities:** Loan balance
- **Equity:** Initial equity + retained earnings

### Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method per ASC 230)
- **Operating:** Net Income + Depreciation (non-cash add-back)
- **Investing:** Property acquisition (negative), improvements
- **Financing:** Loan proceeds, principal payments, refi proceeds
- **Net Change:** Sum of all three activities

## Return Metrics

| Metric | Computation |
|--------|------------|
| **IRR** | Newton-Raphson on equity cash flows (initial investment + annual BTCF + exit proceeds) |
| **NPV** | DCF of same cash flows at discount rate |
| **Equity Multiple** | Total distributions / total equity invested |
| **Cash-on-Cash** | Annual BTCF / total equity invested |
| **Cap Rate** | NOI / property value |
| **DSCR** | NOI / annual debt service |

## Consolidated Reporting

Portfolio aggregation with intercompany elimination per ASC 810:
- Sum all SPV financials by calendar month (not relative month)
- Add ManCo financials
- Eliminate management fees (fees paid by SPVs = fees received by ManCo)
- Validate elimination nets to zero within tolerance

## Calc Module Taxonomy (`calc/`)

76 TypeScript files across 9 subdirectories (`analysis`, `financing`, `funding`, `refinance`, `research`, `returns`, `services`, `shared`, `validation`). Research modules registered in `calc/dispatch.ts`:

### `calc/research/` — Deterministic Research Tools

### Engine Features: Cost Segregation & Working Capital

- **Cost segregation:** Enabled via `costSegEnabled` boolean; split percentages `costSeg5yrPct`, `costSeg7yrPct`, `costSeg15yrPct` allocate building value into accelerated depreciation classes (5/7/15/27.5-year). Tracked in `MonthlyFinancials`, aggregated in yearly output.
- **Working capital:** Modeled in cash flow aggregator. Net working capital changes flow through operating cash flow per ASC 230.
- **Day-count conventions:** `DAYS_PER_MONTH` (30.5) used for revenue; actual-day methods available in `scenario-compare.ts`.

## Edge Cases

### Temporal
- Month 0 / Pre-acquisition: everything zero
- Operations start != Acquisition: debt/depreciation at acquisition, revenue at operations start
- Always use `parseLocalDate()` to prevent timezone shift
- `projectionYears >= 2` required

### Financial
- 100% equity (LTV=0): no debt paths
- Zero occupancy/ADR: valid during ramp-up, fixed costs still accrue
- Negative taxable income: `incomeTax = max(0, taxableIncome x taxRate)`
- Cash going negative: valid business condition, NOT a calculation error

### Balance Sheet
- A = L + E every single month, no exceptions
- Accumulated depreciation capped at building value
