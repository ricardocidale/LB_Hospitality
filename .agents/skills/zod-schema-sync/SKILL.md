# Zod Schema Sync — ResearchConfig

## The Problem

The `ResearchConfig` object is persisted as JSON inside `global_assumptions.researchConfig`. Both the **TypeScript interface** (shared) and the **server Zod validation schema** (route handler) must list every field. When a new field is added to the TypeScript type but not to the Zod `.strict()` schema, the server returns **400 Bad Request** on save because Zod rejects unrecognised keys.

## The Three Places That Must Stay In Sync

When adding or removing a field from `ResearchConfig`:

1. **TypeScript interface** — `shared/schema/research-types.ts` → `ResearchConfig`
2. **Server Zod schema** — `server/routes/admin/research.ts` → `researchConfigSchema` (has `.strict()`)
   - If the field is a `ContextLlmConfig`, also check `contextLlmConfigSchema` in the same file.
3. **Server merge handler** — same file, inside the `PUT /api/admin/research-config` handler → the `merged` object literal that shallow-merges `incoming` into `current`.

All three must list the field. Missing any one causes:
- Missing from (1): TypeScript compile errors or missing autocomplete.
- Missing from (2): **400 on save** — the `.strict()` Zod schema rejects the unknown key.
- Missing from (3): the field is accepted but silently dropped on save, reverting to the old value.

## Checklist (copy-paste into your workflow)

```
[ ] shared/schema/research-types.ts  — ResearchConfig interface has the field
[ ] server/routes/admin/research.ts  — researchConfigSchema has the field with correct Zod type
[ ] server/routes/admin/research.ts  — merged object in PUT handler includes the field
```

## Pattern for ContextLlmConfig fields

```typescript
// In researchConfigSchema:
myNewLlm: contextLlmConfigSchema.optional(),

// In merged object:
myNewLlm: incoming.myNewLlm ? { ...current.myNewLlm, ...incoming.myNewLlm } : current.myNewLlm,
```

## Pattern for simple optional fields

```typescript
// In researchConfigSchema:
myFlag: z.boolean().optional(),

// In merged object:
myFlag: incoming.myFlag ?? current.myFlag,
```
