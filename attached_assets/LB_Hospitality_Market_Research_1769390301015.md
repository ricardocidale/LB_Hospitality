## 1. ADR Growth Rate Research

### Research Objective

Determine appropriate ADR (Average Daily Rate) annual growth rates for boutique hotel properties in the L+B portfolio across U.S. and Latin American markets.

### Industry Data (2024-2026)

| Source | Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|
| STR/Tourism Economics | U.S. Hotels ADR Growth (2024) | 1.7% |
| STR/Tourism Economics | U.S. Hotels ADR Forecast (2025) | 1.3% - 1.6% |
| CBRE | U.S. Hotels ADR Forecast (2025) | 1.6% |
| PwC | U.S. Hotel ADR Forecast (2025) | 1.3% |
| Hotel Online | U.S. Hotels ADR Forecast (2026) | 1% - 3% |
| CBRE | Luxury Hotels ADR Growth (2025 YTD) | 5.0% |
| STR | Economy Segment ADR Growth (2025 YTD) | -1.8% |

**Key Finding:** ADR growth has been running at or below inflation (2.5-3%), with significant bifurcation between luxury/upper-upscale (outperforming) and economy segments (underperforming).

### Boutique Hotel Premium

According to the Highland Group's Boutique Hotel Report 2025:

> "Boutique hotels achieved higher average daily rate than most comparable-class U.S. hotels in 2024. All boutique segments in the report have slowed in rate growth over the past two years, but have also achieved their highest rates during that time."

| Boutique Segment | ADR (2024) |
|------------------|------------|
| Upper Midscale Indie Boutiques | $143 |
| Upscale Indie Boutiques | $193 |
| Upper-Upscale Soft Brands | $253 |
| Luxury Lifestyle | $380 |
| Luxury Indie Boutiques | $440 |

Boutique hotels command a premium over comparable traditional hotels:
- Boutique ADR range: $141 - $440
- Comparable class range: $134 - $353

### Emerging Market Considerations (Colombia)

Latin American hotel markets show higher growth potential:

> "Latin America's average occupancy rate is projected to be 55.3% in 2024. Higher rates are expected in destinations preferred by tourists such as Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, or Cartagena."

Colombia-specific factors supporting higher ADR growth:
- Emerging destination with growing international tourism
- Lower base ADR allows for higher percentage growth
- Currency dynamics and inflation differentials
- Growing digital nomad and remote worker market

### L+B Selected Rates

| Market | Selected ADR Growth | Rationale |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| U.S. Properties | 2.5% | Above industry average (1-2%) reflecting boutique premium positioning and experiential travel trends |
| Medellín, Colombia | 4.0% | Emerging market dynamics, lower base, tourism growth trajectory |

---

## 2. Hotel Management Fee Structure Research

### Research Objective

Determine industry-standard management fee structures to align L+B's fees with market norms while ensuring adequate compensation for comprehensive services.

### Industry Standard: Two-Part Fee Structure

According to HVS (Hotel Valuation Services):

> "Hotel management companies are typically paid a base fee equal to 2.0% to 4.0% of total operating revenue—3.0% being the most common—plus an incentive, typically an incentive management fee (IMF)."

### Base Management Fee Benchmarks

| Source | Base Fee Range |
|--------|----------------|
| HVS | 2.0% - 4.0% of gross revenue |
| DLA Piper (Global Survey) | 2% - 4% of gross revenue |
| Cayuga Hospitality | 3% typical |
| Hotel Development Guide | 3% typical |
| CBRE Trends Survey | 3.6% average (total fees) |

**Additional fees noted:**

> "It has become standard for the management company to add on another one to two percent for 'international marketing' or other service."

### Incentive Management Fee Benchmarks

| Source | Incentive Fee Range | Basis |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| HVS | 10% - 20% | Cash flows exceeding threshold |
| Cayuga Hospitality | 8% - 10% | GOP (standard) |
| DLA Piper | 8% - 12% | GOP |
| Hotel Development Guide | 5% - 15% | GOP/AGOP |
| European Contracts | 8% - 10% | AGOP (typical) |

**Incentive fee threshold:**

> "This threshold is generally reached when the adjusted gross operating profit (AGOP) exceeds a return on the owner's investment (often the development cost associated with the project) of between 8% and 12%."

### Owner's Priority Concept

> "The Owner's Priority is a hurdle or waterfall provision that protects the owner's financial interest by establishing a preferred return on investment before any incentive management fee is paid to the operator."

Typical owner's priority: 8% - 12% of invested capital

### Fee Structure Evolution

> "While a fixed incentive fee percentage ranging from 8% to 10% of AGOP was typical, it is becoming increasingly common to have scaled incentive fees. The tendency towards higher or scaled incentive fees versus higher base fees rewards effective operators but also provides some protection for the owner's cash flow."

### L+B Selected Structure

| Fee Component | Rate | Rationale |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| Base Management Fee | 4.0% | Higher end of range reflecting comprehensive full-service delivery (marketing, operations, finance, HR, IT) |
| Incentive Fee | 10.0% of GOP | Standard industry rate, aligns interests with property profitability |

**Comparison to Industry:**

| Structure | Base | Incentive | Total (at 35% GOP) |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Industry Low | 2.0% | 8% of GOP | ~4.8% of revenue |
| Industry Typical | 3.0% | 10% of GOP | ~6.5% of revenue |
| Industry High | 4.0% | 12% of GOP | ~8.2% of revenue |
| **L+B Selected** | **4.0%** | **10% of GOP** | **~7.5% of revenue** |

## 3. Cash Reserve Requirements Research

### Research Objective

Determine appropriate minimum cash reserve requirements for hotel operations and management company runway.

### General Business Practice

Multiple sources consistently recommend:

> "Most advisors recommend keeping three to six months of operating expenses on hand."

| Source | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Allianz Trade | 6 months operating expenses |
| SCORE | 3-6 months operating expenses |
| American Express | 3-6 months operating expenses |
| Finance Fight Club | 3-6 months minimum |
| Relay Financial | 3-6 months operating expenses |

### Hotel Industry Specific

For hotels specifically:

> "A minimum cash buffer of $219,000 to cover the first six months of fixed operating costs for your Hotel before revenue stabilizes."

Key considerations for hotels:
- Seasonal revenue fluctuations
- High fixed cost base (property taxes, insurance, base utilities)
- Labor-intensive operations
- Event booking cycles

### Restaurant/Hospitality Industry

> "One month of operating expenses (not including COGS) in cash, unless you are not profitable or seasonal. Seasonality and historical cash flow typically drive the calculation."

For seasonal businesses, higher reserves recommended.

### Pre-Opening Period

> "You need a minimum cash buffer... to cover the first six months of fixed operating costs... before revenue stabilizes."

Critical period: Acquisition to stabilization (6 months pre-opening + 36 months to full occupancy)

### L+B Selected Requirements

| Entity | Reserve Requirement | Rationale |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| L+B Hospitality Co. | 12 months runway per SAFE tranche | Management company with no revenue initially |
| Property SPVs | 3 months operating expenses | Balanced approach; cash retained quarterly, distributions only at refinance/exit |

**Distribution threshold:** Cash must exceed 3-month reserve before any distributions are permitted.

| Ramp-Up | Months 4-12 | 50% - 65% |
| Stabilization | Months 13-36 | 65% - 85% |
| Mature | Month 37+ | 85% - 95% |

**L+B Selected Ramp:**
- Starting: 60%
- Increase: 5 percentage points per 6 months
- Maximum: 90%

## 5. Capitalization Rate Research

### Research Objective

Determine appropriate exit cap rate for portfolio valuation at Year 10.

### U.S. Hotel Cap Rate Benchmarks

| Property Type | Cap Rate Range |
|---------------|----------------|
| U.S. Hotels (Average) | ~8% |
| Full-Service Urban | 7.0% - 8.5% |
| Limited-Service | 8.0% - 9.5% |
| Select-Service | 7.5% - 9.0% |
| Boutique (Premium Markets) | 7.0% - 8.5% |
| Boutique (Secondary Markets) | 8.0% - 9.5% |

### International Considerations

| Market | Cap Rate Range |
|--------|----------------|
| Western Europe | 6.0% - 8.0% |
| Latin America | 9.0% - 11.0% |
| Colombia | 9.5% - 11.5% |

### Cap Rate Trends

Current environment factors:
- Higher interest rates pushing cap rates up
- Transaction volume down, limiting price discovery
- Bifurcation between premium and secondary assets
- Boutique/lifestyle commanding tighter caps than commodity hotels

### L+B Selected Exit Cap Rate

**Selected Rate: 8.5%**

Rationale:
- Portfolio blend of U.S. and international properties
- Boutique positioning commands slight premium
- Secondary/tertiary market locations (not gateway cities)
- 10-year hold provides time for market normalization
- Conservative assumption appropriate for investor projections
