# Chapter 3: Capital Structure and Investor Returns

Understanding how capital flows into and out of the business is central to evaluating investment performance. The Hospitality Business Group model tracks three distinct sources of capital and provides a clear path for how investors realize returns at each stage of the investment lifecycle.

## Sources of Capital

### Equity via SAFE Notes

The founding team's cash investment enters the business through SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) notes. These are tracked as individual tranches in the global assumptions, allowing the model to reflect the timing and size of each equity contribution. Equity is the first capital deployed and represents the investors' risk capital.

### Acquisition Debt

For financed properties, bank loans fund the majority of the purchase price. The default loan-to-value ratio is 75%, meaning the lender provides three-quarters of the acquisition cost while the remaining quarter comes from equity. Acquisition debt is sized individually for each property based on its purchase price and the applicable LTV ratio.

### Refinancing Proceeds

After a property has been operating and building value, investors may choose to refinance — replacing the original acquisition loan with a new loan based on the property's current appraised value. The default refinancing LTV is 65%. When the new loan exceeds the payoff amount of the original debt, the excess proceeds are returned to investors, allowing them to recoup a portion of their equity without selling the property.

## How Investors Earn Returns

Investor returns come from three distinct channels, each occurring at a different stage of the investment:

**During operations**, properties generate free cash flow — the cash remaining after all operating expenses and debt service have been paid. This cash is available for distribution to investors on an ongoing basis throughout the hold period.

**At refinancing**, if the new loan amount exceeds the outstanding balance on the original loan plus closing costs, the surplus is distributed to investors. This event can significantly accelerate equity recovery, often returning a substantial portion of the original investment while the property continues to operate.

**At exit**, the property is sold and the gross proceeds are used first to repay any outstanding debt, then to pay the sales commission (default 5%), with the remaining net proceeds distributed to investors. The exit represents the largest single return event in most investment scenarios.
