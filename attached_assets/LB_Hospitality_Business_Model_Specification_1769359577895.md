### Revenue Model

L+B Hospitality Co. earns management fees through a two-part structure aligned with industry standards: a base fee calculated on gross revenue plus an incentive fee tied to profitability. This structure aligns L+B's interests with property owners—L+B earns more when properties are more profitable, not just when they generate more revenue. Properties pay management fees in the same month services are rendered (no collection lag).

| Base Management Fee | 4.0% | Gross Revenue |
| Incentive Fee | 10.0% | Gross Operating Profit (GOP) |
