# Chapter 4: Global Assumptions

## Overview

Global assumptions are model-wide parameters accessible via the Systemwide Assumptions page. These parameters affect all properties and the Management Company simultaneously. Changing any global assumption triggers an instant recalculation of every financial statement in the model.

When a property-level value is not explicitly set, the financial engine falls back to the corresponding global assumption, and ultimately to the system default constant. This ensures every calculation always has a valid input.

## Complete Global Assumptions Reference

### Model Parameters

| Field | Definition | Default Value | Impacts |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Company Name | Display name for the management company | "Hospitality Business Company" | Both entities |
| Property Label | Label used for property type throughout the interface | "Boutique Hotel" | Both entities |
| Model Start Date | First month of the financial model | 2026-04-01 | Both entities |
| Projection Years | Number of years to project | 10 | Both entities |
| Company Operations Start Date | Date the Management Company begins operations | 2026-06-01 | Management Company |
| Fiscal Year Start Month | Month number when the fiscal year begins (1 = January, 4 = April) | 1 | Both entities |

### Inflation and Escalation

| Field | Definition | Default Value | Impacts |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Inflation Rate | Annual inflation rate applied to salaries and variable costs | 3% | Both entities |
| Fixed Cost Escalation Rate | Annual escalation rate for Management Company fixed overhead | 3% | Management Company |

### Management Fees

| Field | Definition | Default Value | Impacts |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Base Management Fee | Base management fee as percentage of property Total Revenue | 8.5% | Both entities |
| Incentive Management Fee | Incentive management fee as percentage of property GOP | 12% | Both entities |

The incentive fee is earned only when GOP is positive. A negative GOP produces zero incentive fee for that period.

### SAFE Funding

| Tranche 2 Amount | Amount of second SAFE tranche | $800,000 | Management Company |
| Tranche 2 Date | Disbursement date for second SAFE tranche | 2027-04-01 | Management Company |

| Tier 1 FTE | FTE headcount at Tier 1 | 2.5 | Management Company |
| Tier 2 Max Properties | Maximum properties for Tier 2 staffing | 6 | Management Company |
| Tier 2 FTE | FTE headcount at Tier 2 | 4.5 | Management Company |
| Tier 3 FTE | FTE headcount at Tier 3 (more than 6 properties) | 7.0 | Management Company |

Staff salary escalates annually at the inflation rate.

### Fixed Overhead (Management Company)

| Technology Infrastructure | Annual technology infrastructure cost (Year 1) | $18,000/year |
| Business Insurance | Annual business insurance cost (Year 1) | $12,000/year |

All fixed costs escalate annually at the fixed cost escalation rate. The monthly cost is computed as: annual cost × (1 + escalation rate) raised to the year index, divided by 12.

|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Travel Cost Per Client | Annual travel cost per managed property | $12,000/property/year |

| Marketing Rate | Marketing spend as percentage of total portfolio revenue | 5% |
| Miscellaneous Operations Rate | Miscellaneous operations as percentage of total portfolio revenue | 3% |

Per-client costs escalate with the inflation rate. Revenue-based costs scale naturally with portfolio growth.

## Instant Recalculation

Changing any global assumption instantly recalculates all downstream financial statements, including the Management Company income statement and cash flow, every property's income statement, cash flow, balance sheet, FCF, and IRR, all portfolio aggregates, and all Dashboard KPIs.

## USALI Benchmark Reasonableness Ranges

The following benchmark ranges represent industry-accepted norms for boutique hotel properties. Values outside these ranges should be flagged for further investigation — they are not necessarily errors, but require justification.

| Metric | Acceptable Range (Boutique Hotels) | Red Flag Below | Red Flag Above |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| ADR | $150 – $600 | $100 | $800 |
| Occupancy Rate | 55% – 85% | 40% | 95% |

## Inflation and Escalation Verification

The model uses two distinct escalation mechanisms, and it is critical that the checker verify each one independently.

**Path 1: Fixed Cost Escalation Rate.** This rate is applied to fixed costs including office lease, professional services, technology infrastructure, and business insurance. The formula is: cost × (1 + fixed cost escalation rate) raised to the year index.

**Path 2: Inflation Rate.** This rate is applied to variable costs including travel cost per client, IT licensing per client, marketing (revenue-based), and miscellaneous operations. It is also used for staff salary escalation.

If the fixed cost escalation rate is not set (null or undefined), the engine falls back to the inflation rate for fixed cost escalation. This ensures all costs still escalate even if only one rate is configured.

### Verification Procedure

To confirm the two-path escalation is working correctly:

1. Set the inflation rate to 3% and the fixed cost escalation rate to 5%.
2. Export the Management Company Income Statement to Excel.
3. Verify fixed costs grow at exactly 5% year-over-year (e.g., Office Lease: Year 1 = $36,000, Year 2 = $37,800, Year 3 = $39,690).
4. Verify variable costs grow at exactly 3% year-over-year (e.g., Travel Cost Per Client: Year 1 = $12,000, Year 2 = $12,360, Year 3 = $12,731).
5. Confirm that setting the fixed cost escalation rate to null causes fixed costs to fall back to the 3% inflation rate.
