/**
 * calc/analysis/consolidation.ts — Multi-property financial statement consolidation.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Combines the financial statements of multiple hotel properties (and optionally
 * the management company) into a single consolidated view. This is essential for
 * portfolio-level reporting and investor presentations.
 *
 * CONSOLIDATION MODES:
 *   - "properties_only": Sums up all property-level statements. Used when viewing
 *     the portfolio's operating performance without management company overhead.
 *   - "full_entity": Includes the management company's financials AND eliminates
 *     intercompany transactions (management fees). This produces a true consolidated
 *     view as if the entire enterprise were a single entity.
 *
 * INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS:
 * When properties pay management fees to the management company, those fees are:
 *   - An EXPENSE on the property's income statement
 *   - REVENUE on the management company's income statement
 * In consolidation, these cancel out (they're internal transfers, not real economic
 * activity). The module eliminates the lesser of (total fees paid, fee revenue received)
 * and checks that they match within tolerance. A mismatch indicates a model bug.
 *
 * GAAP REFERENCE (ASC 810 — Consolidation):
 * Under GAAP, intercompany transactions must be eliminated in consolidation to
 * prevent double-counting. The `fee_linkage_balanced` flag confirms this elimination
 * is complete.
 *
 * BALANCE SHEET CHECK:
 * After consolidation, the module verifies that Total Assets = Total Liabilities +
 * Total Equity (the fundamental accounting equation). If this fails, the `balance_sheet_balanced`
 * flag is false, indicating an error in the underlying property or company statements.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS THE SYSTEM:
 * Called via the dispatch layer as the "consolidation" skill. The financial engine
 * runs this for each projection year to produce the consolidated dashboard view.
