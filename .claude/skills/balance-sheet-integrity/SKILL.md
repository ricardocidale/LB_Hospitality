# Balance Sheet Integrity Skill

## Purpose

Guard the fundamental accounting identity `Assets = Liabilities + Equity` across all balance sheet views in the application: per-property, consolidated portfolio, and management company.

## When to Use

Activate this skill whenever:
- Modifying any file that computes or renders a balance sheet
- Changing financial engine output fields (`noi`, `anoi`, `cashFlow`, `netIncome`, `debtOutstanding`, etc.)
- Adding new asset, liability, or equity line items
- Modifying cash derivation logic
- Working on financial exports (Excel, PDF) that include balance sheet data

## The Golden Rule

```
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity   (variance ≤ $1)
```

Any violation means a calculation error exists. Never suppress or increase the tolerance.

## Cash Derivation — The Most Dangerous Calculation

Cash on the balance sheet is derived from cumulative pro-forma data. The correct formula:

```
Cash = Operating Reserve + Cumulative(ANOI − Debt Service − Income Tax) + Refinancing Proceeds
```

**CRITICAL**: Always use `m.anoi` (Adjusted NOI = NOI − FF&E Reserve), never `m.noi`.

### Why This Matters

| Metric | Includes FF&E? | Use For |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `m.noi` | No (before FF&E) | Income statement display only |
| `m.anoi` | Yes (after FF&E) | Cash derivation, cash flow statements |
| `m.netIncome` | Yes + depreciation + interest + tax | Retained earnings (equity side) |
| `m.cashFlow` | Full cash basis | Direct cash verification |

Using `m.noi` instead of `m.anoi` for cash overstates assets by the cumulative FF&E reserve — typically $3-5M over a 10-year projection with 6 properties.

## Affected Files

### Balance Sheet Components
- `client/src/components/statements/ConsolidatedBalanceSheet.tsx` — Portfolio consolidated BS
- `client/src/components/dashboard/dashboardExports.ts` — BS chart data + exports
- `client/src/components/company/CompanyBalanceSheet.tsx` — Management company BS

### Financial Engine (Source of Truth)
- `client/src/lib/financial/property-engine.ts` — Lines 215, 224:
  ```
  netIncome = anoi - interestExpense - depreciationExpense - incomeTax
  cashFlow = anoi - debtPayment - incomeTax
  ```

### Equity Calculations
- `client/src/lib/financial/equityCalculations.ts` — Equity invested, loan amounts

## Verification Steps

After any change to the above files:

1. **Automated**: `npm run test:summary` — all 3,328+ tests must pass
2. **Automated**: `npm run verify:summary` — must show UNQUALIFIED
3. **Visual**: Dashboard → Balance Sheet tab → no red variance banner
4. **Visual**: Any property detail → no red variance banner
5. **Manual spot-check**: `Total Assets` minus `(Total Liabilities + Total Equity)` ≤ $1

## Common Bugs and Fixes

### Bug: Cash overstated by cumulative FF&E
- **Symptom**: Variance ≈ cumulative FF&E reserve across all properties
- **Cause**: Using `m.noi` instead of `m.anoi` in cash derivation
- **Fix**: Replace `m.noi` with `m.anoi` in the reduce

### Bug: Retained earnings don't match cumulative net income
- **Symptom**: Equity side is wrong, assets are correct
- **Cause**: Missing pre-opening cost deduction from retained earnings (ASC 720-15)
- **Fix**: `adjustedRetainedEarnings = cumulativeNetIncome - preOpeningCosts`

### Bug: Debt outstanding doesn't match amortization schedule
- **Symptom**: Liability side is wrong
- **Cause**: Using wrong month index for `debtOutstanding` lookup
- **Fix**: Use `proForma[lastMonthIdx].debtOutstanding` where `lastMonthIdx = year * 12 - 1`

## Regression Prevention

The rule `.claude/rules/balance-sheet-identity.md` enforces this check. Any agent working on financial code must verify balance sheet integrity before marking work complete.
