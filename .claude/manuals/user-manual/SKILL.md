# Hospitality Business Group — Financial Model Handbook

## About This Manual

This handbook serves as your comprehensive guide to the Hospitality Business Group Business Simulation Portal. Whether you are an investor evaluating a boutique hotel opportunity, an asset manager overseeing a growing portfolio, or an operator seeking to understand the financial mechanics behind the platform, this manual will walk you through every aspect of the model — from high-level business structure to the detailed formulas that drive each projection.

The platform models the complete financial lifecycle of a boutique hotel portfolio: acquisition, operations, refinancing, and exit. Every number you see in the application traces directly back to the assumptions you provide, and every calculation adheres to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (USALI).

This manual is organized into sixteen chapters, each covering a distinct aspect of the financial model. You may read it cover to cover for a thorough understanding, or jump to specific chapters as a reference when working with a particular area of the platform.

## How to Use This Handbook

If you are new to the platform, begin with Chapters 1 through 5 for a solid foundation in how the business is structured and how properties move through their lifecycle. Chapters 6 through 13 provide detailed coverage of the financial calculations — revenue, expenses, profitability, debt, cash flow, balance sheet, and returns. Chapter 14 covers the management company as a separate financial entity. Chapters 15 and 16 address the assumptions framework and the verification system that ensures calculation integrity.

Throughout this handbook, formulas are presented in plain notation, and default values are stated directly. Where relevant, we reference the applicable GAAP standards (ASC 230, 360, 470, 606) and USALI guidelines that inform the model's design.
