# Free Cash Flow (GAAP Method)

## Section ID: `cash-flow`

## Content Summary
Cash flow statement using GAAP indirect method (ASC 230):

### Three-Section Structure
1. **Operating Activities**: Net Income + Depreciation (non-cash add-back)
2. **Investing Activities**: Capital expenditures (if any)
3. **Financing Activities**: −Principal payments + New debt proceeds + Refinance proceeds

### Key Formulas
```
Net Income = NOI − Interest Expense − Depreciation − Income Tax
Operating CF = Net Income + Depreciation
Financing CF = −Principal + Debt Proceeds + Refinance Proceeds
Total Cash Flow = Operating CF + Investing CF + Financing CF
```

### Free Cash Flow
```
FCF = NOI − Total Debt Service (Interest + Principal)
FCFE = FCF − Additional Principal (cash to equity holders)
```

### Critical Rules
- Principal is **never** on the income statement (ASC 470)
- Depreciation is added back because it's non-cash (ASC 230)
- Cash flow reconciles to change in cash balance
- No negative cash allowed
