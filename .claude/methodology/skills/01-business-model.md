# Business Model Overview

## Section ID: `business-model`

## Content Summary
Explains the two-entity structure of L+B Hospitality Group:

1. **Management Company (L+B Hospitality Co.)** — Earns management fees from operating boutique hotels. Revenue = base management fees + incentive fees from property portfolio. Expenses = staff, office lease, professional services, technology, travel, marketing.

2. **Property Portfolio** — Individual boutique hotel properties. Each property is modeled independently with its own revenue streams, expenses, debt, and returns. Properties feed management fees up to the management company.

## Key Concepts
- Two separate P&L structures that interact via management fees
- Properties can be "Full Equity" (no debt) or "Financed" (with acquisition loan)
- The model projects both entities over the projection period (default 10 years)
- Consolidated view combines both entities
