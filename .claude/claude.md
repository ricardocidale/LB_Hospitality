# Hospitality Business Group — Project Instructions

## Project Summary

Business simulation portal for **Hospitality Business Group**. Models a boutique hospitality management company alongside individual property SPVs with monthly and yearly financial projections. GAAP-compliant (ASC 230, ASC 360, ASC 470). ~806 source files, ~145,995 lines, 2,941 tests across 127 files. Hosted on Replit.

---

## User Preferences

- Simple, everyday language. Ask clarifying questions before implementing — do not assume.
- **TOP PRIORITY: Financial accuracy always beats UI enhancements.** The 2,941-test proof system must always pass.
- Always format money as currency (commas, appropriate precision).
- All skills stored under `.claude/` only (never elsewhere).
- Company name is "Hospitality Business Group" (or "Hospitality Business" for short).
- Update skills and manuals after every feature change.
- All UI components must reference a theme via the theme engine.
- New UI features get their own skill file in `.claude/skills/ui/`.
- **Button Label Consistency:** Always "Save" — never "Update". See `rules/ui-patterns.md`.
- **100% Session Memory:** Save decisions to `.claude/session-memory.md` at session end.
- **Every financial line item** should have a ? tooltip (HelpTooltip or InfoTooltip).
- **Every page must be graphics-rich** — charts, animations, visual elements required.
- **Context reduction is mandatory.** Every refactor must produce skills, helpers, scripts. See `skills/coding-conventions/context-reduction.md`.
- **Premium design, always.** $50K+ bespoke financial platform feel. See `rules/design-standards.md`.
- **Always update claude.md after every task.** Mandatory — no exceptions.

## Current Theme

**Tuscan Olive Grove** (olive-sage) is default. 5 presets available. See `.claude/skills/ui/theme-engine.md`.

---

## Context Loading Protocol

With 168 skill files, **never load all skills at once**. Use `.claude/skills/context-loading/SKILL.md` to find the minimum required set. Quick rules:
- **Financial calc** → specific finance skill + `rules/audit-persona.md` + `proof-system/SKILL.md`
- **UI/visual** → `component-library/SKILL.md` + `ui/theme-engine.md` + specific UI skill
- **Testing** → `testing/SKILL.md` + relevant sub-skill only
- **Cross-domain** → 2–4 skills max per domain

## Recent Changes (March 12, 2026)

- **Infrastructure Contracts Optimization** (12 workstreams) — Sealed IStorage facade (9→11 classes), unified SDK contracts (4→8 health-checked integrations via BaseIntegrationService), enforced 6-domain boundaries with proof tests, protected 36 deterministic tools with registry test, eliminated duplicate hooks, extracted hardcoded constants, fixed all TS errors.
- **7-Dimension Codebase Audit** — UNQUALIFIED across all dimensions (Formula, Lineage, Assumptions, Workflow, Reporting, Code Quality, GAAP). Fixed 3 findings: hardcoded cap rate in document-ai templates, undocumented research benchmark, KB confidence threshold.
- **Domain Boundary Rules** — 6 independent domains (Financial Engine, AI Agents, Photos/Media, Research, Documents, Notifications) with prohibited cross-imports enforced by `tests/proof/domain-boundaries.test.ts`.
- **SDK Integration Health** — All 8 integrations report to `/api/admin/integrations/health`: Twilio, ElevenLabs, Gmail, Stripe (dormant), Plaid, SendGrid, Geospatial, Document AI.
- **AI Property Image Generation** (Task #31) — Replicate architectural rendering for property photos.
- **Plaid Financial Reconciliation** (Task #23) — Bank linking for actual vs projected comparison.
- **3D Globe Flyover** (Task #38) — Interactive Three.js globe visualization.
- **Document Intelligence** (Task #26) — OCR document extraction + DocuSign e-signatures.

## Key Rules

- **Calculations always highest priority** — never compromise financial accuracy for visuals
- **No raw hex in components** — use CSS variable tokens
- **All buttons GlassButton**, all pages PageHeader, all exports ExportMenu
- **No mock data** in production paths
- **Finance changes must state Active Skill** and pass verification (UNQUALIFIED)
- **ANOI terminology**: After-fee NOI = "Adjusted NOI (ANOI)". Internal field stays `noi`.
- **Marcela must NEVER compute financial values** — all data from the calculation engine
- **Engine chain**: `gop = revenue − opex`, `agop = gop − feeBase − feeIncentive`, `noi = agop − expenseInsurance − expenseTaxes`, `anoi = noi − expenseFFE`
- **Brand colors**: SAGE=#9FBCA4, DARK_GREEN=#257D41, NAVY=#1A2332, SECTION_BG=#EFF5F0, ALT_ROW=#F8FAF9
- **normalizeCaps() abbreviations**: GOP, NOI, AGOP, ANOI, GAAP, FFE, FF&E, DSCR, IRR, CFO, ADR, REVPAR, LTV, EBITDA, WACC
- **Icon standard**: `IconPlay` for "Run Research", `IconEye` for "Criteria", `IconBanknote` for Reconciliation

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|

## Database Migration Pattern

All migrations are idempotent SQL scripts in `server/migrations/`. Each is wired into `server/index.ts` startup sequence before `seedAdminUser()`. Migration files: `prod-sync-001.ts`, `prod-sync-002.ts`, `research-config-001.ts`, `inflation-per-entity-001.ts`, `companies-theme-001.ts`, `icp-config-001.ts`, `marcela-voice-001.ts`, `property-photos-001.ts`, `plaid-001.ts`, `documents-001.ts`.
