# Testing & Proof System — Master Skill

## Purpose
Documents the full 963-test automated verification system. Every financial statement, analysis, and engine calculation has dedicated tests that prove correctness without manual Excel verification.

## Commands
```bash
npm test                              # Run all 963 tests
npm run verify                        # Full 4-phase verification (UNQUALIFIED = pass)
npx vitest run tests/statements/      # Statement tests only
npx vitest run tests/analytics/       # Analytics/returns tests only
npx vitest run tests/engine/          # Engine (property + company pro forma) tests only
npx vitest run tests/financing/       # Acquisition financing tests only
npx vitest run tests/refinance/       # Refinancing tests only
npx vitest run tests/funding/         # Funding instrument tests only
npx vitest run tests/proof/           # Proof system (scenarios + hardcoded detection)
npx vitest run tests/auth/            # Auth utility tests only
```

## Key Invariants (All Tested)

| Identity | GAAP Reference | Test Location |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| A = L + E | ASC 210 | `statements/balance-sheet`, `statements/cashflow-identities`, `proof/scenarios` |
| OCF = NI + Depreciation | ASC 230-10-45 | `proof/scenarios` |
| NI = NOI - Interest - Depreciation - Tax | ASC 220 | `proof/scenarios` |
| CFF = -Principal + Refi Proceeds | ASC 230-10-45-15 | `statements/cashflow-identities` |

| FCFE (Direct) = FCFE (From NI) | Valuation identity | `analytics/fcfe-reconciliation` |
| NPV = 0 at IRR | Finance identity | `analytics/npv-irr-crosscheck` |
| Σ(SPV fees) = OpCo revenue | Intercompany | `proof/scenarios` (5), `engine/company-proforma` |
| Consolidated eliminations = 0 | ASC 810 | `proof/scenarios` (5) |

## 5 Golden Scenarios (tests/proof/scenarios.test.ts)

| # | Name | Tests | Entity Level |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Cash Purchase (Full Equity) | ~12 | Property |
| 2 | Financed Purchase (LTV) | ~12 | Property |
| 3 | Cash → Refinance Year 3 | ~12 | Property |
| 4 | Portfolio Aggregate | ~8 | Consolidated |
| 5 | Consolidated + Eliminations | ~8 | Consolidated + Mgmt Co |

## Maintenance Rules

1. **All 963 tests must pass before any merge** — run `npm test`
2. **New financial calculations require new tests** — add to the appropriate domain directory
3. **New constants go in `shared/constants.ts`** — never inline magic numbers
4. **Hardcoded detection scans 8 finance files** — `proof/hardcoded-detection.test.ts`
5. **Update this skill and sub-skills when adding test suites**
6. **Only UNQUALIFIED audit opinion is acceptable** — run `npm run verify`
