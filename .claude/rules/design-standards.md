# Design Standards

Every page must look and feel like a premium, bespoke $50K+ financial platform. No page should feel like a plain data table or generic AI template. Default shadcn/Tailwind is the starting point, never the finish line.

> Page-level requirements and component catalog: `.claude/skills/ui/graphics-component-catalog.md`, `ui/page-enhancement-checklist.md`

## Required on Every Page

- At least one interactive animated chart (Recharts — gradient fills, custom tooltips, smooth animations)
- Framer Motion: page transitions, staggered list reveals, micro-interactions
- Section headers with icons (Lucide)
- Skeleton loading states while data loads

## What "Premium" Means (non-negotiable)

1. **Animated numbers** — Financial values animate on change. Never snap.
2. **Micro-interactions** — Every interactive element responds with subtle motion.
3. **Layered depth** — Glassmorphism, backdrop blur, shadows, gradient overlays. No flat cards.
4. **Custom charts** — Custom tooltips, gradient fills, animated entries, glow effects. No default Recharts gray grid.
5. **Smooth transitions** — Every route change, tab switch, content swap is choreographed. No hard cuts.
6. **Staggered reveals** — Lists and grids cascade in. Never all at once.
7. **Skeleton loading** — Every data section shows shimmer/skeleton while loading. No spinners alone.
8. **Typography hierarchy** — Playfair Display for headings, Inter for data. Mix weights deliberately.
9. **Color with purpose** — Use full theme palette. Accents for CTAs, muted for secondary.
10. **Spatial rhythm** — Consistent spacing. White space is a tool.

## Design Principles

1. **No bare tables** — Always pair with a chart or visual summary
2. **Animated transitions** — Page changes and data updates animate smoothly
3. **Branded consistency** — All visuals respect active theme colors (no raw hex)
4. **Progressive enhancement** — Skeleton first, then animate content in
5. **Data density with clarity** — Dense but readable; good hierarchy

## Banned Patterns

- Plain white cards with thin gray borders
- Static number displays
- Hard page transitions
- Default Recharts appearance
- Lists that appear all at once
- Spinner-only loading states
- Buttons without hover/press states

## Edge Cases (must be handled with premium quality)

- **Empty states** — Beautiful illustrated placeholders with CTAs, not blank pages or "No data" text
- **Loading** — Full skeleton matching page structure; long ops show progress with context text
- **Errors** — Styled error cards with retry; never raw error strings
- **NaN/Infinity** — Show "—" with tooltip; never display raw NaN
- **$0 values** — Display as "$0", never blank
- **Negative values** — Red/warning color with parentheses
- **Reduced motion** — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; disable animations, maintain visual quality

## Skills to Load for Design Work

| Task | Load |
|------|------|
| Adding charts | `ui/charts.md`, `charts/SKILL.md` |
| Adding animations | `ui/animation-patterns.md` |
| Adding 3D elements | `3d-graphics/SKILL.md` |
| Building a new page | `ui/page-enhancement-checklist.md`, `ui/graphics-component-catalog.md` |
| Mobile graphics | `mobile-responsive/SKILL.md` |

## Verification

1. Does this page look like it cost $50K+ to design?
2. Are numbers animated? Static = violation.
3. Do cards have depth? Flat = violation.
4. Do transitions feel choreographed? Jarring = violation.
5. Do lists stagger? All-at-once = violation.
6. Are loading states skeleton-based? Spinner-only = violation.
